Reddit,Today I received my sign to take a break ,My was in a   year very up and down relationship from     -      Things ended notoriously badly as they do in the types of relationships   I haven t spoken to my ex fianc  in nearly two years  she s married everyone moved on but both friend groups dislike each other now  and today I saw her best friend on Bumble  She must ve gotten a divorce  so whatever  that s fine  I was surprised to see her so I was scrolling down her profile  she looks good  But I don t like her and I m sure she doesn t like me  well  we all know how easy it is to Superlike someone on accident and there s no taking it back   I was mortified  My daughter could hear me yelling SHIT  across house  haha   I deleted my profile rather than let her think I meant to do that  
Reddit,Facebook dating shows up as an option on my substitute account but not on my real account  What gives ,I m the last single person among my friends  several have recommended FB dating but it just will not appear on my main account  It will  though  on the same phone using a backup account I do not intend to date with  I m already frustrated from being lonely  I don t need to be aggravated by this shit too  Any thoughts 
Reddit,Advice  please,I was chatting on bumble with a woman  She seemed a bit over excited to meet me  so I gave more time between chats hoping she would cool her jets  Tbh I had too much work on my hands as well   One day I find out she undid our match  Yesterday she sent me a Facebook friend request  She didn t know my last name  So my guess is she found me on Google search  Not a difficult thing after some information we shared  She sent a few messenger lines saying she said she missed me and hoped I was well   What should I do  Block her  Or simply let the request hang there until she forgets about me  I m not interested in chatting any further with her  But I m a bit fearful she might be a stalker  What are your thoughts 
Reddit,Is it worth swiping right if you don t get likes ,Was having this debate with a buddy of mine who says because he s not getting any likes he doesn t bother swiping  I said it could be his profile  but I still swipe right selectively even though I rarely get likes too   What are your thoughts 
Reddit,Requesting constant photos - why ,Why do men  I m a woman so I don t know what women do  constantly ask for photos when you start chatting    before we ve even met   I feel like I always need to convince them to meet by sending them a bunch of damned photos     is that what it s about 
Reddit,Do men enjoy texting before the first date ,Chatting with a guy on an app  I asked if he wanted to meet up  He said definitely  gave me his number  We haven t scheduled anything yet because neither of us are available for    days  He s been texting me daily  not annoying or over the top  I m just curious if this is something that men do because they are excited or like texting  Or if they feel like this is what women want they need to do to stay relevant  I don t like to text alot before the first date and plan to tell him so once something is scheduled but I am a little afraid of offending him 
Reddit,Getting sad over getting ghosted  Weird ,I didn t even know her  I matched with her on Hinge and I thought she was very cute   similar interests  It usually gets me excited because most girls on these apps are really boring to me  and girls who are both physically attractive and with similar interests are kinda rare  She was enthusiastic at first  and I don t think I said anything wrong at all  She ghosted me out of nowhere  I don t understand why  It sucks 
Reddit,Does anyone pay for a service ,I m curious  so many of the big sites charge for every little thing as they struggle to survive    Does anyone pay for these  I mean  if their terms weren t so off putting  I might  Maybe I just want to pay for   or   months  and not have to go through the cancelation process which seems difficult    Any advice for this- paying then canceling later  Things to be aware of   Thanks 
Reddit,Question or vent off  Amazing convo one day and then nothing  why ,Hey   So  I      have been having great conversations with several people throughout the last couple weeks  I am cool with keeping up the conversation going  and if they are reciprocating I make jokes and ask questions or even if the conversation if dry comment on it and make a suggestion and turn it around    Then  the next day we exchange a couple messages and I of course don t expect non stop conversation everyday  it would be nice  but we are adults and life happens  But then  nothing  I message most of the time to check in  but I don t get a response for several days  And sometimes never   I had a situation where the guy would just disappear in the middle of the conversation and never even said sorry the next evening    So  I understand they may be busy  they may not be into me  they may be bored of OLD etc  But this happened several times  I had a    year relationship and then found my next bf quickly online  dated for     years  I wasn t even looking for a relationship which made it easier not get disappointed    My question is   Is this the new norm  Like should I be expecting this  I don t know what to do in this situation  How long do you wait for a response  Should I just keep them as a match or unmatch like after a week so they are out of my mind  How many times should I remind myself if I kinda liked the person   I was ready to give chance to people that I thought cute and I liked their profile  Now  I am thinking unless I see someone and say yes this is my dream guy gal  I don t want to put any effort in it  I need equal amount of effort put in  so I think this is important to me  I want to feel like I am wanted  I made my profile intense-ish so that people know I want something serious  Like I put in that I am looking for someone to fall in love    What do you do in these situations  Should I see online dating as a socialization option or a place to just practice flirting  Please tell mewhat is up 
Reddit,Why do younger people have NO conversation ,I m saying  people  because maybe it s the same with men  I don t know  my experience has been with women  Even women that were actually interested in me  that went on dates with me or even slept with me  the majority of younger women have no conversation skills or are uninteresting as hell  The ones that knew how to handle a conversation and show personality were the older ones   How is that  Is our generation particularly socially inapt 
Reddit,I am genuinely curious  is online dating past your   s just a completely joyless experience ,I am a male  I ve kept my looks I think and am     I am financially well off  However there is literally zero girls that I am bothered with  Even if the girl is v attractive it takes me a bit to be bothered let alone feel she would be a good match  However I don t even have this opportunity  I match with some girls who are okay looking but I am just not going to date them  I have to be very attracted and if that s not there its just pointless  The problem is this mindset makes me overly latch onto someone who does meet that criteria and I become over caring where my strength is actually how little I care and how content I am by myself 
Reddit,is this a red flag ,  I    f  matched with a guy on bumble and we decided to meet yesterday  An hour before the decided time to meet  he messages that he s still at work   would like to meet at        I was really excited to meet him and was really disappointed as I don t really want to meet a stranger this late at night  After showing him some disappointment  he dint really do much to make it up  He was like sorry can t leave work and I left him on seen  He hasn t messaged after that  Did I do something wrong   Also he s confused about what he wants   I want a relationship
Reddit,Facebook dating age requirement,I ve been using facebook dating for a year or so now and when I try to go to dating it says Your dating location has age requirements  I m    years old and facebook has my right age I m just curious if this has happened to anybody else on fb dating
Reddit,Did the apps punish me for having a month and a half break ,Hey guys  I was doing quite well on hinge and tinder     likes for a guy  Lots of meet ups  And bumble     likes   I then went on a date with this girl  she abused me and shamed me for not being     and laughed about it  It really hurt my confidence  I basically stopped using the apps maybe ocassionally swiped but didn t respond to matches or really use the apps at all tbh  I needed a break    A month and a half later I m trying to use them again  First off I noticed I lost    likes off my hinge  And my tinder went from     down to       Also I don t seem to be getting and new likes anymore and barely any matches  On ocassion it happens but I used to get at least one new like a day on tinder and hinge    What happened    It is possible to fix this  Do I have to buy a boost or something to get people to see my profile again  I m guessing my score went down for being inactive or something  I have good photos though  you can see them on my wall actually    Bumble I barely have   likes and get almost no new likes as well  Please help guys   
Reddit,Yuzu everyone is far away  ,So I ve been using Yuzu for a couple of weeks now  Even though I live in NYC   where there should be a preponderance of Asians  let alone people in general   lately all the people in my stack are hundreds of miles away  It s not even like I m massively overswiping  Is anyone else finding this sort of issue 
Reddit,should i give up on my crush ,here s the backstory me F   and this person M     he is really shy btw  have been talking since december     i saw his profile on hinge  and i ve decided to send him a message  we went to the same high school and we had classes together but we didn t start talking until now  since we ve started talking i ve told him that i love voice calls and that i prefer them over texts  although with this info that i ve given him  he hasn t called me and every time i try to bring it up he says  oh yeah we should  also he lives five minutes away and we haven t hanged out yet  i keep giving him hints of the days off that i have from work and all he says is  yeah we should hang out sometime  and i told him to set a time and date and he agreed  it s been a month and we have yet to hang out and or even have a simple call  i think he is a cute guy and very intelligent and i d love to be more close with him  he has complimented me a few times as well  am i wasting my time here or am i rushing things 
Reddit,The Flakiness and the White Lies on the Apps are Wild ,Here s a little story that happened this week   On Saturday  this woman from NYC liked me on Hinge  and we matched  Instantly  we were having multiple chat-bubble conversations about everything about each other  we were definitely very interested in each other   Monday she suggests I come up to the city to see her on Friday  today   I ask her if she s cool with Midtown  and she says yes  and I ask her where in Midtown does she want to meet up  does she prefer bars  restaurants  or museums for our first date  etc  She stops texting me Wednesday   Until she stopped texting me  she was pretty fast at replying  I was curious what happened  so while I was checking our chats yesterday  I saw that her location on her profile changed from NYC to somewhere in France  Weird   Anyway  today I text her to ask if we are still on or not for NYC  to which she says we are not  and that she is sorry that she can t  since she is  going through a lot right now   This is when I noticed that the location on her profile is now ITALY   I don t know if this woman was even real  or some bougie European man swept her off her feet and flew her out to Europe or what  Maybe I m quick to judge here  but     The flakiness on these stupid apps isn t uncommon from my experience  I ve been getting a fair amount of matches a day on these apps recently  today I got over     and it never goes anywhere 
Reddit,Advice please   ,So a few weeks ago I started talking to this person on bumble  we both had a lot of common interests and she was really interesting  She seemed pretty enthusiastic about the conversation but when I asked her if she wanted to meet up some morning for coffee she said she gets overwhelmed very easily and needs to take things super slow  I told her I understood and assured her that I would be patient  and that if she was more comfortable texting or calling me on the phone instead of messaging on bumble that was cool  gave her my number  She just said she wanted to talk through bumble a bit longer to feel comfortable  Cool with me  We ve been talking every day for about three weeks  I m being careful not to make her feel pressured because I want her to be comfortable  Last time I talked to her she said work had been crazy and she was feeling burnt out  I told her I hoped she got some rest and I hoped tomorrow was a little easier  That was three days ago and no reply  I m trying to be patient and I m hoping she s just busy but I want to reach out really bad  I don t want to bother her if she doesn t want to talk anymore  I sent her the last message  but maybe I m supposed to reach out again  I m not sure what to do next  Wait or check in 
Reddit,Why is dating online hard ,I have been able to match with a few woman over the years on these apps but they were a total waste of my time    A large majority of the women I matched with were a long distant away and I did match with a few nearby but they were just on the app to waste your time  very boring to talk to or just wanted to hookup   Most of the women that liked me only seemed interested in hooking up or they rushed their feelings for me too soon  some of them were pretty but I didn t feel comfortable rushing into a relationship so soon    The women I did match with that found me really attractive were like in Europe  Asia or Africa so there was no way I was gonna get on a expensive plane ticket just to go see them so I cut them off and quit the dating online dating entirely because I can t seem to match with anyone serious near me   Why doesn t anyone in online my country wanna date me  I m a hard working man that works two jobs until I come home exhausted  I have a lot of skills like fixing cars  doing the plumbling  fixing stuff or simply changing your tire  Why would a  woman wouldnt a man like me    Edit  just to clarify these women I matched with were real because I videocalled them time to time just to chat or show them my life 
Reddit,When I set my daiting profile to guys I get likes almost instantly ,This has been a weird thing  If I set my Tinder  Facebook  Bumble to match with guys  Within a few hours I have multiple likes  I am a   M who is straight  Does this happen to other guys as well  I recently had a really creepy incident to where an older coworker wanted to explorer Facebook dating  So I changed my age preferences to     Within   hours of changing my age  I had over    likes matches with guys that were in their   s and   s 
Reddit,Why is online dating so much harder than irl ,This is my first time trying out online dating after many years of being in a relationship and I guess I missed out on the better times which is the early days  I consider myself to be quite a social person irl and talking to friends on texts and didn t had much difficulty back when I was dating   First  profile  I tried making a good one but I know there s a lot of rooms for improvements and because I was in a relationship for so many years  I never bothered taking photos especially the recent years lol   Second  openers  I think I m slowly improving on this after trying out for awhile now but man it s still really difficult  How do you even come up with good ones even looking at their profile and trying to come up with interesting ones that is not hey or how s your day  Sometimes I think I got a pretty good opener to prompt but no replies but it s fine  a good practice  On some apps like Hinge  I gave a pretty good reply to their prompts  they matched but don t reply or say anything expecting me to continue  wow it s just   depressing    Third  conversations  So finally after sifting through so many profiles and got to the stage of matching and after the initial openers  comes keeping up with the conversation  Sometimes I get that good starting conversation going but I feel like it just went downhill from there like how do I keep up with this  It s mentally draining to keep trying to be engaging and sometimes they re quite responsive  until they re not and it feels like dead conversation again   Last but not least  asking them out  I feel like I may be asking too soon so I try to chill on asking them out but when I finally do  sometimes it feels like they re not really that keen or so busy that the plan could be weeks later instead of that weekend lol   Online dating seems like a totally different game and it s feels like I have a lot to learn 
Reddit,I m old enough to know    m  not to get too obsessed with looks then I matched with someone who is really gorgeous ,I m not saying that looks don t matter  yet I do know that it s important to be realistic and not get carried away with appearances  I was just browsing on a dating app  and I come across a woman holding her dog  she s wearing  sunglasses with blonde hair that is partially covering her face  Not the best picture  but I can tell she s pretty hot  kind of  out of my league   I swiped right without reading her profile  and the app says we matched    At first I was like  really   Then I go back and look at her profile  she sounds really cool  And her other picture truly gorgeous  Almost  too perfect   I know I m probably overthinking this  What s the best way to compliment someone without sounding creepy or  thirsty  
Reddit,Glad she blocked me ,I   m  met a very pretty girl    f  online     We chatted for a few days and finally planned to meet in person for a drink     In the days leading up to the date  we texted over iMessage   Just basic keeping in touch and telling about our day   On the Thursday before our Friday meet-up  I was heading out to meet up with some friends guys    I showered and dressed nice and took a selfie in the mirror and sent it to her    Heading out to meet up with friends  I said   Her response was   your friends or your wife    I thought that was odd  but just sent an  lol   and replied that I have been divorced for    years already   She didn t respond   I liked the picture I took of myself  so I uploaded it to my dating profile      While I was out with friends  she texted me    Did you actually post the picture you took for me    Feeling weird  but not really  I said   yes why     She replied   That speaks volumes  Lose my number    And blocked me on her phone and on the app   Pretty possessive from someone I hadn t even met yet no 
Reddit,What are some tips you d give to an online dating newbie ,Hey all    F here - so I have pretty limited experience with dating apps  due to all my past relationships started as organic connections  I ve been single for about a year and a half and recently started to miss dating so I gave Hinge a whirl  I matched with   guys to start off  made plans to meet all of them the same week  Thu  Fri  Sat   and  paused my profile   personal preference to help me focus on the immediate dates    I clicked with Mr  Thursday right away - which didn t happen with Mr  Friday   Saturday   I ve respectfully let them know I had a good time but didn t see anything going further after each   As for Mr  Thursday  we ve been talking every day since the first date  and I had a second date with him  which felt more like the first actual date and he held my hand   We ve just been getting to know each other  but we ve both been pretty transparent about our mutual interest in each other  We have serious conversations and also talk about things to do together   I ve never clicked with someone off of online dating before so I m a bit scared - I kinda dig this guy but it s so strange to want to date someone I know so little about  given my history of only having dated men I knew well personally   I think I also have the  it s unrealistic for things to go well with the first guy  line of doubt when all I ever hear about are the woes of online dating   Do any of you have tips for a newbie to online dating   Some specific questions if you don t have anything general to toss out  should I   unpause my profile   and continue looking for additional dates despite how things are going well with this guy  a la don t put all your eggs in one basket   Are there   any flags to look out for when dating strangers   with whom you have no mutuals who can vouch for their character  When should I be optimistic and when should I be pessimistic about a date   If any of you make the time to read through this and share tips  thank you 
Reddit,He responds quickly but gives answers that don t give me much to go on  Why does he do this ,Matched with a guy  on Bumble  and we ve been messaging for about a day now  Like the title says  he s quick to respond to me  but he also doesn t ask me questions about myself and so I ve become the one carrying the conversation and asking all the questions  Normally would think that if he s not asking questions back he s just not interested but usually this happens when the guy is slow to respond  So why would he respond quickly if he doesn t seem interested and care to get to know me 
Reddit,Why online dating is so hard for both genders ,It s like a     degree difference  but it affects both genders  Women have SO many matches with men  it s overwhelming  When you are getting      matches a day  week  it s hard to pick one guy based on a profile picture  This goes for all online dating   For men  it s the opposite problem  I feel like if you wanted to see an average guy  that is me  I m      dad bod  thinning hair     years old  I may get   matches a month  My story is probably true for the vast majority of men   What happens is you have women with so many choices in men  they become overwhelmed and go after  for the most part  the best looking guys  Let s be honest  if it was reversed and men had all the matches  this exact same thing would be happening to us    Those of us men who are average are kind of left in the dust  We cannot compete with the top guys  Leaving a lot of men feeling bitter and angry   I do not know what the answer is  A lot of both genders are miserable with dating  but for vastly different reasons  What do you think could be some answers  Would love to hear everyone s thoughts 
Reddit,How to make it clear you don t do hook ups without saying  no hookups  ,I m     I ve clearly chosen the  looking for a relationship  and  want kids  options on my profile  I don t give off any vibe either with behaviour or clothing of someone who is looking for a  nd date hook up  Yet I am so sick of guys dropping me after I don t go to their place by the second or third date  They act very interested  until I don t respond to their hints to go to their place  And then they disappear   Also happened with guys I met IRL  before I used dating apps at all    I don t have any rule of any sort about when I d sleep with someone  I guess it s when I become comfortable  Especially with guys from dating apps it takes me longer because they are a practical stranger after all    But I don t know what else to put on my profile to make it clear  Obviously none of that  no time wasters  or  serious guys only  stuff  it is very off putting  but I don t know how else to say it      Looking for relationship-oriented men    I don t want to scare anyone off either  in a world that is commitment-phobic as you know it  and this sounds like it might scare people off   I want to get to know people to see if we share values  chemistry  goals  etc  and see where things go  I don t want to  boyfriend up  the first guy I meet  But I don t want anyone to think anything else either  Any suggestions   PS  I feel strange here I am being bashed that I m basically a prude for not sleeping with a stranger after meeting him twice  I wasn t asking for advice on this either   I guess this speaks of the expectations and dating culture overall  If you will lecture me on why I have to sleep with someone after  -  dates so I don t hurt his ego  don t bother - I am who I am and my level of comfort regarding these things won t change because of a reddit comment 
Reddit,Online dating scammer is going that extra mile,I was already suspicious but I was bored  He is supposedly  M    Divorced    child    Talked  to the guy on Bumble for two days   He asked for my number to video chat  I use a  nd line on my real phone for these things  We  exchanged numbers and set a time to call   He called and hung up before I answered  It was only on the second ring   I called the number back  No answer   I get a text that he had his son for the evening and couldn t video chat  Fine   We scheduled for two days later   This person is using some type of still shot with a voice talking        So much feedback and noise in the line  I turned my camera off  He never even mentioned it   I asked why he wasn t Live  He said he was not at home and didn t want to show other people but didn t want to miss the video chat again   We talked about    minutes   He is supposedly living in NY for    years   Born and raised in Indonesia  He has sent a bunch of photos  English is good but thick accent  All professional looking so I go to the identify pic app and sure enough the photos are stolen   I didn t tell this person the jig was up   I said send me a photo with today s newspaper  He photoshopped the correct New York Times front page with another of the stolen photos   Day   and today he is so in love with me he can t hide it any longer  Each fake photo he sends  he now puts the current date and a time stamp on it   I gave this person fake info to go with his fake info    I blocked the phone number today 
Reddit,Advice please,  Recently met someone online   me    her      we ve now had   dates   She s stunning and funny and has a real big personality and against the odds she seems to like me    Problem being   I don t have a big personality like her   I m quite a slow burner   I don t feel like I m enough   I actually feel a bit intimidated by her   which is a shit state of affairs I know     This is probably due to a lack of belief in myself    Ordinarily i might come up with a reason not to carry on but I really don t want too    I ve talked to family members about how I feel she s out of my league   they just tell me I m a great guy and I should just go with the flow    Perhaps I m not looking for advice   perhaps just a few words of encouragement just to stop me sending her some shit message that ends things   which I ll later regret     Thanks for reading

Reddit,No social media a red flag ,How would you feel if someone you met didn t have social media  For example  you meet online  exchange numbers and talk on the phone  text etc  eventually you meet and person and they seem really cool  Would them not having social media be weird to you 
Reddit,She changed her mind mid conversation ,I    m  was dating a   f  We had been on   dates  regular flirty conversation  She suddenly texts me she had to cancel our date and ends things  This was the day after our date and less than an hour after flirty texts   Wtf just happened  Any theories of why someone would change their mind in the middle of the day    minutes after flirting   Further info  she claimed to be sick first cancellation and actually ending things happened next day
Reddit,Should I just go for it ,Should I just go for it   I ve been texting a girl on and off for a few months  I never built the confidence to ask her on a date so the conversations we had were very brief  There were times were I could ve kept it going but just left her on read   As time passed I worked on myself mentally and physically  and now I m more confident  A few months ago I slid up on an instagram story with the worst pickup line of all time and I got left on delivered    Weeks passed and I messaged her again and she replied but when I tried making conversation she left me on delivered  This happened on   occasions    I m wondering if I should just straight up ask her if she wants to go for drinks whenever she s free    I feel like she thinks I m just wasting her time with countless meaningless convos  so I think a more straightforward approach is better  but I d like your opinion on this 
Reddit,Hinge only gives   free likes a day rather than   ,Hey guys  I paused my profile late last year and decided unpause it earlier this week  Since then  it has only given me   free likes a day  I thought it used to be    Did they change that 
Reddit,I am    and starting to look at online dating stuff and it really is daunting, update  throw in I am a widower and makes it more challenging  Any advice on approach and what sites to use  I am all ears on this now  Thanks for all the comments given  Its no doubt a daunting venture into this world even for younger people  made worse when older      of all the responses so far are really nothing more than scammers  I know how spot and deal  I feel for those who are taken advantage of  Again  thanks for all the comments
Reddit,Keyword search ,Hi daters   I    M  met my ex on match in       and sadly that didn t last   I am divorcing  and have  sandbox  accounts on Facebook Dating  match and pof - in  take a break  or with profiles made invisible while I look around   I don t think that I will date before my divorce is final  but it might depend on how slow things are   I m pretty disconnected and healthy  but I know I m not done   Something I used to use on multiple sites was a keyword search   Instead of poring over every profile  I would search for who talked about hiking  or biking  or whatever  so that I could prioritize those women   I don t see that anywhere so far   Match was always bad at revamping their whole damned UI every couple of months and it looks like they tossed that feature in a purge   And with the swipe model  which I barely touched back in the day   I wonder if any major site or app has keyword search these days   Has anyone seen this lately 
Reddit,Ghosting sucks,Why do people do it  Had a match ghost me before we could finish setting up a date she agreed to originally  Everything seemed well  texting on and off all day  Then poof  If you re not interested  just tell that person  Think about the other person  I had   matches besides her  even   likes  Really my only hope and I was being gaslighted into thinking something could actually turn out  It sucks  How do you go back to the app with   likes and start swiping again  It s such a morale killer  Don t have the time to be going to places to meet people  nor do I have the skills or patience for it  Clearly I don t have the patience for this either  
Reddit,First experience  ,So my wife is divorcing me after    years so I put my info pictures on an online site but didn t pay then this woman tags me so after a few days I finally paid to read her message and respond as I d already seen her pictures and profile  Well after just a couple of messages we made a simple bike riding date  It was fabulous  We made such a nice connection   I ve seen her again and another date is planned  It s like too good to be true 
Reddit,Pig Butchering  Are other women being targeted ,Recently me     year old female  jumped back on Tinder and had conversations with over    guys from different European countries who now claim to live in my city      These guys are always talking about cryptocurrency  even though I ve made it clear that I have no interest in it  They also have pictures that appear genuine  but I couldn t find any matches when I did a reverse image search       While they do bring up other topics  cryptocurrency always seems to be the main focus  Some have asked me to invest  and I am very clear that i will never invest in a date   I m wondering if this is a common scam where men with questionable English skills are hired to deceive desperate women or if they are independent scammers     Evrery single time I ask them about pig butchering and they stop talking to me  am I the only one being targetted by these men 
Reddit,Does anyone else not have social media ,I deactivated facebook  I never got into instagram  and I briefly downloaded Snapchat when matches kept asking for my snap but I have since deleted the app from my phone when I stopped using dating apps    I find a lot of people expect you to at least have an instagram so they can see more about you  more pictures  what you re about  who you follow  etc  I m embarrassed to start instagram because I d have no followers which would make me look like a red flag  It s frustrating because I don t want to have to use social media to get people to like me  Why isn t messaging on the dating app itself enough for most people 
Reddit,Dating on Reddit  Women s Inboxes    Over Inundation     Or Manageable ,Help out guys in general here       Just for all of the women here on Reddit that post to any of the Dating Subreddits     I m looking to gauge whether not receiving any kind of response from a Woman  is more likely due to being rejected  or if it happens to be because of a logistical problem with simply receiving  too many responses  to go through   by    Or maybe a combination there of     If this is more the case     Then what percentage ratio would each of you subjectively apply to each of your own Inboxes respectively  off the top of your head   Is it true that once you post on a Dating Sub  that your inboxes become inundated  and unmanageable to sift through to find the type of guy that you re looking for  due to simply having  way too many  Response Messages or Chat Invites    I m looking for each Woman s Individual Experience in this  and only if you ve posted on any of the Dating Subs here on Reddit   Thanks    
Reddit,Letting older women know that I m interested ,M   here  I m on Hinge and Feeld and  even if I don t mind dating girls my age  I particularly enjoy the company of older women  over      I d like to precise that on my profile to let them know I m cool with that interested  but I don t wanna come off as fetichizing or creepy  What would be some smooth appropriate ways to do that   EDIT   Gotta clarify myself     is not  old  in itself  It s at least   years older than me though  that s why I say older 
Reddit,Do you keep the sporadic conversations going or focus on engaged people ,I    M  can t not notice that almost everyone I ve ever slept with or even kissed from OLD was a breeze to talk to and meet  Engaged conversation in text  no big pauses  has time to meet right that week  no reschedules  just acting like a person who actually wants to see me  Very rarely I could turn a bad situation around and get a girl out who forgot to reply for a week  but they ended up being uninterested in person too  So it looks like     of my results come from     of the effort   I m thinking if a girl matches me and they take   days to reply to my first text  or they reply once a day every day  or they disappear for a week and re-emerge  I ll just cut all of them off  I know I m gonna lose a small fraction of people who just happened to have a tough few days  but are actually interested  But in reality  the first   texts look like a miraculously good indicator of how the rest of our story will go  Opinions 
Reddit,What s the most absurd thing someone wrote said to you in online dating ,Once  many years ago   i was chatting with a man and we talked about meeting each other  I suggesting going for a coffee and he said  I can t talk to woman on a date  I will not be able to say a Word  Let s just meet and have sex immediatly without talking first  I am to shy  We can talk after we had sex   I would love to hear your similar stories  - 
Reddit,Dating slowly,Just a question  everyone seems to aim for the numbers game  Max amount of dates as possible  is it just me or does that sound awful to anyone else  I have enough energy for like maybe   dates a month  When i find someone and start talking to them  i just talk to them and maybe   other person and straight up ignore everyone else stop swiping all together cuz i cant handle multiple conversations  I seriously dont have the energy for it even if i  know  statistically itl just take me longer to find someone cuz most dates turn into rejection  Does anyone else feel the same level of not really caring to max out your week with dates 
Reddit,Got posted in a  do not date  group   ,Started talking to a girl off tinder last week  Small talk  keeping it clean and PG  Moved off tinder and a female friend messaged me the next day and asked if I d heard of these  do not date him  or  are we dating the same guy  Facebook groups  I said yes  and she told me I d been posted by an anonymous member  I told her I appreciated her letting me know and asked her to keep an eye on the comments    Well a day later    women have commented  All positive things    a couple women I m friends with  a couple past flings  and one I went to school with   I guess it does pay to be a nice guy once in a while  Even tho women seem to like jerks    I know women aren t supposed to share what happens in those groups  But regardless I feel a little violated  I haven t told the girl from tinder that I know she posted me  Not sure if I will either  But she does want to hang out now lol 
Reddit,Is anyone else noticing more and more people using AI photos for their profiles ,I m not talking about scammers bots btw  I m talking legitimate profiles  They ll usually have a mix-profile starts with a very obvious AI photo of themselves and then a couple real pics of themselves  I m seeing this occur more and more with mens profiles  how often is this happening on the womens side     It s just really off-putting and weird imo  Like do they not realize we know  Is it an attempt to look  cool  
Reddit,Stating that I don t want man-haters on my profile,I ve been on Hinge for a short while  and saw a couple of profiles of women being a bit too comfortable saying they disliked men   I don t like this mentality  so I just added a prompt basically saying to fuck off if you were the kind of spreading hatred towards men  I didn t say it like that though  I worded it much more politely and stated that I was looking for positive people    I m curious to know if other people did the same thing  whether you re male or female   And if so  did it affected your matches positively  or even negatively    EDIT   Yeah  I removed the prompt and replaced it by something more positive  in this case  that I was attracted to older girls  
Reddit,FB dating profile disabled   ,I did the video thing  it said it  couldn t be confirmed  and so im disabled and all I can do is delete the account    What the fuck im not a catfish  I ve done  report a problem    times now  I can still edit my profile  Doesn t mention anything on how to remedy the situation  Of course I can t make a second Facebook to try and make another dating profile  I m verified on bumble  tinder and hinge and I d be willing to show my ID so I have no idea what the issue is 
Reddit,What s a good number of dating app site profiles ,New to dating  online or off   I already have an eHarmony free account in the hopes of finding a relationship  but I ve heard people mention or even encourage having multiple profiles across different apps   I m all for casting a wider net  but I want to keep things manageable  What might be a good limit to give myself so as not to get overwhelmed with watching my feeds   Also  any recommendations for what apps to use  I ve been considering Match  Hinge  and Bumble  I have some friends who met on there and married last year  
Reddit,JSwipe experience,Hello  so I m interesting finding a relationship but finding someone who s the same religion as me has been tough with the other dating apps  some luck with Hinge  slight luck with Bumble   I decided to give JSwipe a try and I wanted to ask for others experience using this app  As a female I wanted tot ask do other females get matches and no one initiates any conversations  Is this the norm on this app    sigh 
Reddit,If the very  st message is asking to meet up does that mean they just want sex ,Yesterday I made a post about generic profiles that got a bit heated and inspired this post   For context    I get a lot of opening messages from guys who simply ask  shall we go for a drink    As do most women on apps   I m not a prude nor do I really want to spend much time texting mindlessly  But it always puts me off if they don t ask me any questions before asking to meet up    It come across they don t have anything better to do than meet up with a stranger and get laid  At least by asking questions you can suss out whose looking for fun or whose looking for substance   The same way I want to see if someone is worth meeting up with I want the other person to have some standards that go beyond look  Please  if you feel comfortable state whether you re F M 
Reddit,Very attractive girls,I am a     guy  average looking  never stood out type of face with an athletic body  I have always gotten decent numbers of matches online  and some very attractive ones  However yesterday a girl matched with me and messaged me first calling me cute  and she was drop dead gorgeous  brightest blue eyes with brunette hair  perfect everything  i asked my gay friend and he said she was a     out of     I continued the convo and she wants to meet  im almost embarrassed to see her irl  I just know that she would be treated nice wherever she goes and people will wonder why im with her  All in all im terrified to go on a date as a girl is a lot more attractive than me 
Reddit,How to reinitiate a conversation ,I matched with a girl on Hinge  She sent me the first message  I responded and asked her a question related to her profile  I never got a response  It has been over a day  How should I go about reinitiating the conversation 
Reddit,When people put  Not political  is that code for  I don t know enough about politics to discuss  ,I understand not wanting to talk about politics  I think thats a dangerous game  especially in the early stages of dating but I am confused how anyone can say they  arent poltiical  when politics effect every facet of society  
Reddit,Too close to home,I just swiped a little and saw someone I found interesting but the distance scared me off  It was less than a mile away    On one hand I think getting to know someone who lives that close to me could end awkward  On the other hand that s how lots of people meet   I don t want to close myself off due to someone just being literally right in front of me   What is your experience getting to know people who live close by    saying  getting to know  instead of  dating  cause I feel like that is far fetched right now 
Reddit,I ve gotten no matches on Bumble since they removed the free compliments  Has anyone else had this issue ,I have gotten almost no matches for about a year  I ve noticed a year ago bumble took awhile the   compliments every    hours or so option  and now you can t send any compliments without paying  Through swiping I get no matches  However  on facebook dating or meetme or dating sites where you can message  I ll at least get some matches  Idk if I m shadow banned on the site or what  Or if I should pay for compliments  Make a new profile  Any suggestions  and has anyone else noticed the same thing that they have gotten no matches since Bumble removed the compliment message option 
Reddit,What apps sites have higher amounts of conservative women ,God forbid I claim to be a one on Reddit  but I grew up in a conservative area and currently live in a more liberal county due to when I was finishing up college and work  I ve tried most of the major apps and no surprise  it s like     of women are liberal  I know that more women in general are liberal than not  anyways   I m    M  I just want someone who shares some values as me  Or at least doesn t really care about politics  I absolutely could not date someone with mostly all opposing views as me   I m usually told  go meet women at church  or told to cold approach women in public  I don t go to church and cold approaching seems a little creepy  IMO  I also don t do clubs nor bars solo not my scene  I ll go drinking with a friend now and then but that s infrequent   As such  it feels like dating apps are my best bet  which is extremely unfortunate  Which have the highest amounts of conservative women  Besides Christian Mingle  probably  I d still consider myself a very loose Christian but religion has never been that huge in my life  Also I thought that site was for people like     tbh   Or at least apps that let you filter by political views for free like Bumble on PC 
Reddit,Tinder Gold -        a WEEK ,Who is paying    bucks a WEEK for Tinder  Or you can upgrade to a month for the low price of     a week  At   months it s    a week aka     a month   Is  anyone  actually paying these prices  I d think   bucks is a month is fair for the minimal features Tinder Gold gives you 
Reddit,Does Facebook Dating show the person themselves as a mutual friend ,Weirdly have come across someone I m friends with on Facebook dating  however under the mutual friends section  it shows them as a mutual friend   Is this a thing  Or a glitch  Or is someone they re friends with pretending to be them 
Reddit,Men  it s insane competition  Saw first hand last night with lady friend and I making profiles at same time ,Me and my female acquaintance made Bumble profiles simultaneously when we were bored at a work gathering last night   I m     she is     so that may be a factor but still it is insane   This morning at breakfast  she asked me how many likes I received overnight   I had       Thought I was doing great   She shows me her phone      likes  In less than    hours while people are normally sleeping         So men  that is what you are up against  Honestly seeing this makes me surprised I ever get a response from women  Basically a full time job for them sorting through the men 
Reddit,Girl says I don t seem engaged in the conversation  Do I just forget it ,Matched with a girl   weeks ago and hit it off immediately  We live two hours apart but had a ton of convo on Hinge and then moved to text  I ve been trying to set up a date but she s in med school and super busy  which I understand  Tentatively have something set up for     when I ll be in her area    I almost always text her first in the morning even though she gets up before me  Nbd  Generally we text a few times throughout the day and then a lot late in the evenings when she is done with her studies  On Wednesday we had more texting than usual  meaning like   straight hours vs   hour  and she said it made her night  On Saturday night we also had a ton of texting  On Sunday I didn t text her between       and     pm  and then she never texted me but I texted her again at       was watching the football games     Anyways  we went back and forth on a couple things and she says  doesn t seem like there s much to chat about anymore  You don t seem engaged at all so is there a point    I m thinking - you could have also texted me if you wanted to chat during the   hours between your text and mine or the   hours between my two texts    Also thinking - does every day have to have     texts going back and forth to make it a worthwhile day of engagement    Literally the day before this she s calling me babe and borderline sexting  Then   hours of no messaging means I am no longer engaged and there s nothing to talk about  Okay   Guess maybe I am dodging something here if this is her maturity level or communication needs  I was already trying to figure out when I could see her in person and if it lead to an actual relationship  how I could ever go on dates more than every other week at best with her insane school schedule  But really strange how she has to have constant contact or she feels like I m no longer interested in her    Am I off base here and this is normal or does she just have strange communication needs  Insecurity on her part 
Reddit,Worried about saying wrong things over text and making things awkward,I always regret sending texts whenever the girl doesn t respond back  I start to think that maybe I said something weird  asked something she didnt understand and it just caused her to stop responding due to the awkwardness or her not knowing how to respond   Usually I try to reach back out weeks later to restart a whole new conversation  but most of the time she just disappears for good and I never hear back  I think that maybe the text miscommunication mistake I made earlier caused her to lose interest  Anybody face this issue too and how to get over that mindset  Or am I just overthinking

Reddit,Facebook Dating Issues,This is a dumb question  but ever since Facebook Dating rolled out  I ve been curious about trying it out  Problem is  I ve never been able to access it  All my friends have  and my primary partner  we re poly  has been able to  as well  I ve read up on all the possible reasons it isn t available   It s only available in certain countries  I m in the US  and everyone I know has been able to access it  so it s definitely not that    You have you be      I am well over     and my profile reflects that   You have to be using the app  I am   Turn your location services on  I did   Turn your notifications on  I did   Delete the app  restart your phone  reinstall the app  I did    Any other reason I wouldn t be able to access it  
Reddit,Should I Keep Pursuing This ,So I    f  met a guy on a dating app    m  he sent me a message and I responded  We hit it off immediately  We had so much in common even my more niche interests  He was funny  sweet and just seemed like the shy cute nerdy type  Which is my type  Now we started texted kind of irregularly on my part due to life but still pretty consistently  Even if I took forever to respond he was patient and kind  Now fast forward to about a month and a half later  Still talking  We finally breech the subject of exs and sexual partners  I decide it s about time to confess  I am a virgin and I m asexual  Now I am a sex interested asexual but none the less asexual  My drive is very low as I don t experience sexual attraction like other people  I decide to just lay it all out there  I have very little dating experience on top of no experience in sex as well  He takes it all well  In fact he gets kind of excited about my confession saying I m rare and it s amazing  Which strikes me as odd  He questions me a bit on the asexual part and I just tell him the truth of everything  All in all he takes everything well  However this is where stuff starts to kind of turn  After this conversation he stays kind of tame but makes little semi sexual flirts and jokes that I don t really mind  But then he makes a comment about how I couldn t handle more  I ask what he means and then that really changes the way our conversations go  He begins sexting me  asking very sexual personal questions and talking about the very graphic things he d like to do  Now I must say I didn t really mind all of this at first  It was kind of fun  I m fine with some sexy conversation but that s pretty much all our conversations are now  And I have made it very clear multiple times that for me I need a strong emotional connection before I could actually be physical  Don t get me wrong we have very strong sexual chemistry at least from what I can tell lol Just because I don t have experience doesn t mean I don t have some idea of what I ll like and he ticks every box in that department  We have a lot of kinks in common though his are a little more intense than mine and he definitely has more  However I kind of feel like that s all we have  We are lacking in conversation and connection outside of that and I want to bring it up and try to work on that  However there have been a couple red flags that make me think that I should just give up  Firstly I don t like that he keeps pushing more and more sexual stuff onto me and that he almost seems like that s all he s interested in but before all of this he was so sweet and asked me lots of questions but now nothing  Secondly I kind of feel like he likes that I m a virgin because he can kind of  train  me to fit his more extreme kinks  I m not sure that s just kind of the vibe I get  And the last thing is he is in the mood like all the time  and has been pressuring me a lot to send him nudes which I am not comfortable with at all and have expressed that  But now I don t even know how to keep saying no so I just kind of say I will when I m more comfortable  At this point I don t know what to do there are so many things I like about him but it almost feels like I like who he pretended to be and the person he is now is just interested in sleeping with me    I want to also add that at this point we have been talking for   months and I just realized I think he thinks we are in a relationship  which we are not  He has asked but I said it s still too soon and dropped other little hints if he mentioned it  I wanted to follow the three month rule  And one other things that is concerning for me is he is very adamant that he wants children in the future and I have been very adamant that I do not ever want children  He said we could talk about it again in the future  But it kind of makes me nervous because if we did keep talking and eventually sleeping together he doesn t want to use protection and then what if something happens  I can just see a lot of possible problems  But I also have a fearful avoidant attachment style so sometimes I don t know if I m just in my head too much 
Reddit,Very confused    I  M    was rejected for being           ,Chatted with this girl after matching for a full day  Normally I don t chat that much before meeting up  but the conversation was flowing really well     we had a lot in common  and she even wanted to meet up that night  Anyways  after all of this she says  Can I ask a question   I said  Sure  and she asked me my height  I said         She didn t look super tall or anything  She was maybe       or        After I answered her question  she instantly unmatched me    I couldn t believe it  Would a girl that short really care if I m not taller than         Do girls like that exist  I honestly don t care  but it surprised the hell out of me  LMAO 
Reddit,What is everyone s biggest challenge problem with online dating  And what  if anything  is going well ,I straight male live in a big city  am over     and get quality matches on apps - as measured by appearance  professional academic background  and well-roundedness    But I find very few people I match with seem to be interested in something more serious  let alone a second date  I question how much is me - like I show well on a profile  but don t impress in the same way on a date  Versus how much the basic realities of dating at my age - i e  many people who are  quality  and never married by     having impossibly high standards  avoidant tendencies  lack of interest in LT partnerships  etc   So for me  the positive is that the app is doing what it s supposed to - connecting me to people I meet IRL  The downside is I m not getting the outcomes I want    What is everyone else experiencing  either negative or positive  
Reddit,Pausing dating app,Just wondering if you guys have any advice on this    I was talking to a few girls on dating apps and went on a few dates  I matched with someone recently and went on an amazing date where we both felt our goals aligned plus the chemistry was definitely there too    Do I pause my dating profile   Should I let my matches know I found someone and want to pursue the relationship  Especially those I already hooked up with       Any advice would be appreciated
Reddit,Why do some people WANT to know about number of past sex partners ,I made this post because the previous one about this topic was locked  but anyways I never understood when some people ask or volunteer info about number of sex partners in the past   intimate details about sexual encounters  what age they lost their virginity  etc    I ve only had a few girls ask about that stuff and the few who did were kinda crazy  Like they d ask or share that info on or before a first date and maybe I m in the minority but I m like um  why are you asking sharing this  Like whether someone s been with   person or    people before me  I still don t wanna know that stuff  And I think it s just as odd for guys to do this too  For example  a friend of mine in the past she had a date with this guy who bragged about  an awesome threesome  he had to her  Like wtf  why would you share that with someone you re potentially trying to date  especially that early on  About   years ago  I also had a girl tell me about how she recently had a pregnancy test and was worried about how she was pregnant  And also had an abortion  Don t get me wrong  I m      pro choice  but also that doesn t mean I wanna hear the details specifics  especially on a first date   I just feel like these types of conversations never end well  regardless of what the answers are  Usually the person asking is either insecure or maybe judgmental   It s like that scene in Clerks where Veronica flips out on Dante for sleeping with    girls and he flips out for her sucking    dicks      x   B 
Reddit,Get no matches on Hinge but I get lots on other apps,So I am not sure whether it is me or Hinge  I use Tinder  OkCupid and Hily and a couple of other niche ones and in total I have LOTS of matches  I decided to give Hinge a try but in a few days I have only gotten one match with a girl  I put my preferences to everyone out of curiosity and I get inundated with shit loads of these dudes giving me roses or whatever the Hinge thing is called  I am so confused  Hinge always shoves this boost and subscription feature in my face   To use Hinge  do you truly need to boost yourself subscribe to it  My profile is not bad far from great but it sees a lot of success in other apps  What gives  
Reddit,When setting a time and place for a date feels like jumping through hoops,When she says she isnt available and it seems hard to nail down a time and place for a date  do you feel that it increases the chances of the girl ghosting  Especially when she doesn t offer alternatives or help make it easier for you to meet up with her in person  I m pretty direct and specific about date and time  so it does work for the most part  But for some girls  when she doesn t say yes the first time   it feels like a mistake that can t be reverted and now she s gonna lose interest  I feel like the more  hurdles  and obstacles that come up when trying to set up plans to meet  she ll stop responding and just disappear  It almost feels as if you screwed up trying to ask her out  Then I think  maybe I should ve just stayed penpals  Anybody else experienced this too  Any tips on how to avoid these situations 
Reddit,How long to give myself to figure out my feelings ,So  I ve    F  had   dates with a guy    M  I met irl then later matched with on bumble  I like him  he s very nice  I enjoy spending time with him and talking to him  he s incredibly interesting and makes me laugh  I also find him extremely physically attractive  However  I m not sure how strongly I feel about him  and I m not sure if this is a case where chemistry may build over time  or I m just not feeling it  or maybe I rushed myself into this situation  as I got out of a short  couple of months  and very intense relationship about a month and a half ago   I don t want to waste his time or hurt him if I can avoid it  he seems to be very into me and  as much as I like him  I m not there yet  I am wondering how much time is reasonable to give myself to figure out if I will get there  He is aware that I got out of a relationship not that long ago  and has been incredibly kind and patient and let me take the lead on boundaries and physical affection and hasn t been pushy at all  all we ve done is hug   It s really wonderful  he s really wonderful  I m trying to take it date by date  and my friends are encouraging me to just see what happens  I feel like I just don t really know how to date  maybe  I have only really been trying to date since late September  before that I d been in a couple of long term relationships with people I met irl 
Reddit,Pros and cons of matching and potentially dating someone who is religious ,A few days ago I matched with a girl on hinge who I could tell was religious based on what she wrote in her prompts  but I gave it a go and we talked on the phone for a bit last night  mainly because the weather had been cold and rainy the previous few days   I thought the call went well as we talked about different topics  but I did notice a lot of times during the call she mentioned about her faith and how she is always doing stuff with church etc  Anyways today she messaged me that she thought we wouldn t be a good match because she prefers someone who is very religious like her  and that was fine being though I have my own faith I am not not super religious like I guess she preferred   So today I noticed on hinge and bumble now of religious girls popping up to match with  So my question to everyone out of curiosity is what are some pros or cons to potentially dating someone who is I guess really religious 
Reddit,How common is it for people to ask others to email them a dating proposal ,Every now and then I ll come across profiles that ask others to email them a dating proposal in one of their prompts like this  https   imgur com BA ffq    At first I thought it was a one off thing  but I ve been seeing an uptick in profiles asking for this  Someone told me it was a TikTok trend  Is this a common thing people do now   For reference  I m a   M and I ve been seeing this a lot on Hinge  but I ve seen it a couple times on Bumble as well 
Reddit,I went from weekly dates in Austin to hardly any in Atlanta  Is the scene just tougher out here ,Hinge is my primary app and I went from  -  matches each week to  -  in Atlanta  I thought when I moved out here that I would have more success as a black man since there is a lot more black people here  but I was dead wrong    Is the competition just more fierce out here  Is anyone else struggling in the dating scene in Atlanta  
Reddit,I do this weird thing to increase the amount of people seeing me  does this actually work ,What I do is I go on the app in the morning and swipe once so that I appear as  active today  then in the afternoon when most people are using the app I do the rest of my swiping  Am I overthinking it 
Reddit,Why is every app full of east asian girls  desperate to get you on whatsapp and how are they verified ,I ve had this   times today  I match out of the misguided belief that one of them  might be real  and it d be a shame to miss out on a pretty girl just because you assume she s a bot   Now  I ignore the blatant obvious fake profiles  but the ones you do talk to  they re desperate to get you on whatsapp but even after this  it never really goes anywhere  It s not like they straight up ask for credit card details  the conversation is like talking to a bot at times  but sometimes it feels more genuine    What s the angle here  and how are they verified  Ive started using bloom  on account of being banned from pretty much everything else for no reason  and they use a video verification where you have to move your head around like it says  and if it doesnt work it can be manually reviewed   I m aware of the pig butcher scam and all the other things  but thing is  none of these profiles over the years have ever actually tried to scam me  Am I that ugly that I m not even worth scamming   D  What gives 
Reddit,Recommendations for Free Dating Accounts,Recently got into online dating and started with eHarmony with a free account  While I don t have issues with the site per se  I m not crazy about some of the stuff stuck behind a paywall  I m curious how the basic account compares with others   I wanted to ask if there were any recommendations for other apps  specifically their free low cost tier offerings  I can respect the argument for paid accounts deterring scams  but a lot of the prices I ve seen are ridiculous  
Reddit,First time a women   f is fully reciprocating and I m getting nervous   m - online dating, Let me start of by saying I have zero dating experience  I ve been on dates but haven t been in a relationship before and it s made me miserable from the inside  A lot of insecurity about it ngl  So I start using this app to improve my second language and I messaged a lot of girls to just get myself more comfortable talking with them and I messaged this one girl who looked cute on her profile pic   Our convo was pretty basic but I reached out a lot to her and she asked if I had instagram which I replied no and offered my snap and we added each other there to start talking  She responded so quickly to my snaps and the flow of the convo was great  a few dull moments but I figure that s normal she s human too   We talked about everything really  After about  ish days talking things start picking up and we started flirting   This is the first time I ve had a girl desire me almost more than I desire her  In all honesty  she s so beautiful it s hard to believe it  She is so infactuated by my looks that she was slam dunking me with compliments  She said she d fall for my charm if we saw each other in person and how beautiful my smile was and just so many other things that I just started to freeze inside  I ve never had a girl openly desire me like this and it s making me nervous   I fully reciprocated despite my nervousness  She sent me a pic of herself in her bed without makeup and she still lit up the room  She was insecure before sending it and apologized for not wearing makeup  Long story short  she sent me a final message tonight saying she had to go to bed  lives in a different time zone  but said I could send her more pics of me if I want for her to see when she wakes up and she wished me a good night with a kiss face  She never used emojis when we initially started talking and she came off as stoic in the beginning   She told me she s dated   guys in her life and said the first two she was young and I don t remember about the last one  Am I over my head in this situation  Checks out she s not fake also so no worries regarding that she s a real girl lol
Reddit,How many dates without sex before you decide they ve  wasted your time  ,Maybe I m just bitter  but I get this sense that a lot of guys treat first date conversation as foreplay  a necessary evil  or a way to determine whether she is high status enough that he ll not feel ashamed about sleeping with her  Even the  nice  ones who come off as respectful and say all the politically correct things  Now that I have a certain number of bad experiences under my belt  I don t want to get physical with someone until trust and friendship is firmly established  But it seems no one wants to make the investment to get to know someone  You gotta test drive the car asap so you can move to the next one if there isn t  chemistry   never mind that trust is key to chemistry    Update  Thanks to those in the comments who ve made it clear that a lot of guys really do think this way  No more apps for me  I ll meet people irl where you can read nonverbal cues and aren t already on a date with them the first time you see them  These online dating rules and rituals are absurd 
Reddit,Is double texting really a red flag ,Ok  here s the situation  Nothing crazy in depth  talking to my match for the past few days  Maybe  -  texts at most per day  I opened up talking about an interest we share I saw on her profile  Last night I sent my last response  and I m looking at it now thinking I kind of left it close off  not open for an answer if that makes sense    I know the idea is to get off rhe apps asap  and I wanna try to do that at thus point  She obviously hasn t responded since  which I understand not everybody has      availability  Just the only match I really have rn  and I think she s cute and shares the same ideals on her profile  I want to send a message telling her that  A like  Hey I think ur cute  do you have a   sc so we can keep talking and set something up   Is this a bad idea    Sorry  I m not good at this stuff  Still young and very inexperienced  I m sure this has been discussed on this sub before  but couldn t find anything  so bear with me   
Reddit,He asked for a hookup and I said no but kind of regret it,Met a guy online and we ve chatted for about a day but he s going to be out of town for a while  so is looking for something casual and told me so  Basically asked me whether I would be interested in hooking up  I m looking for something long-term but was on the fence still when he asked because he ticks a lot of the boxes I look for in a guy and so I would be curious meet him  But I turned his offer down because I had a bad experience with getting intimate with someone else too soon  although at least this guy was being honest about what he wanted   He said ok and said if I wanted to meet up somewhere late evening instead to let him know  late evening because I work in the evenings   Probably won t end up happening since I m also wary of meeting people for the first time late at night  and I feel disappointed since I ve had little luck recently with OLD in terms of even getting a guy to respond and don t know if I really made the right choice even though rationally I think I did   Also wondering if I should ask this guy if he d be interested in staying in touch or something even while he s away  Or ask about letting me know if he s interested in meeting up when he s back   Edit  Thank you to the people who offered advice 
Reddit,Is this a red flag   ,I met this guy online and everything has been going great  We have many things in common  he s smart  caring and funny  We haven t met in person yet but we had a video call which also went pretty good  We were texting the other day and I told him that I normally can tell how a person is by looking at them in the eye  then he proceeded to send me a photo of himself in the shower with his shirt off and looking straight to the camera  It felt a bit off and then he asked me if he was making me uncomfortable  then I said no  and he proceeded to send me a photo of his entire body but to the point that you can almost see his private parts  Then I told him that I would have prefer the first photo and not the second photo  since I like to take things slowly  He said  Alright  He also sometimes makes comments very subtle about us doing stuff together in the future  like going together to the Alps  I want to know if I m overreacting  
Reddit, I m focusing on you  what does that mean  if we re not in a relationship ,So this guy and I matched and the first date was hot  but then I found out he s only looking for a fling while I wanted a relationship  so I said maybe this wouldn t work out   We still talked and I was thinking internally that maybe it wouldn t be so bad to have a bit of fun because all life  I ve just had serious relationships and it was always so dramatic  Obviously he was still into me  otherwise he wouldn t be talking to me  I said I would be open to try out a fling   Ever since  we ve talked everyday  and have gone on two dates  three dates within a month so far  and a couple of times  he would ask me how my dating app game was going  I would say I m not using it much  and he would say the same thing and say   I m focusing on you now    For me  mentally  even if I m not in a relationship  I don t have the bandwidth to accommodate two or more guys at once  But I could see he was asking to know if he was just a notch on my belt  Whereas for him  I know he likely isn t seeing someone else  due to his schedule   but I can t be too sure he isn t swiping on apps  even if he did say he is  focusing on me    Which is what is concerning me  because I m starting to wish I was seeing someone who wants to have a relationship  This is fun  but I m     so I do think about marriage and stuff and he clearly has different career plans  so probably isn t thinking about marriage for a long time   I want to start looking out for other guys again  but I don t know what  focusing on me  means  A guy friend said it means this guy likes me and wants to be with me  but I don t know when he would want to commit  If I can find a man who wants to commit now  why wouldn t I focus my time and energy on him  instead of endlessly waiting for this guy   I don t know when to ask him if it s alright that I start looking out  because it feels like something I should ask in person  but it s like breaking up over a dinner  which is something I myself would not like   So basically my questions are  what does he mean by this statement  and when should I tell him I d rather start seeing other guys if he doesn t want to commit 
Reddit,Lack of connection,So  I have met a few guys from online dating apps  We have had lots of good chats - texting and voice note   When we have met in person  it s just so different  Getting to know someone via text is completely different to knowing them in person  in my opinion   Most of my dates haven t progressed past the first one    I d be interested to hear your thoughts on this if you relate   - 
Reddit, I don t know why I m even on here   ,Do people just say this on their bios because their egos can t handle having to resort to using apps to find dates or something 
Reddit,This is obviously a scam  right ,I leave a comment on somebody s photo on Hinge  About a day later  they match with me  replying only with a couple emotes  I ask them a question and they say they aren t on the app much and ask for some other way to communicate like a number    with formatting like this     Sorry Idon t check here often     if    you don tmind  leave a   of    yours    for bettercommunication  It s like a purposeful pattern  but one that nobody would actually write unless they were trying to be cute or reach a certain demographic  like in phishing scams   And considering it s the first thing they said to me and they didn t say their favorite thing is weird poetry that looks vaguely like a haiku  I m pretty sure it s not the  st one lol 
Reddit,Hinge,Do you have to pay to get or receive any messages  I can t seem to use hinge without hitting  a pay wall  is nothing on there free 
Reddit,Banned for nothing,Woke up this morning to find I was banned from Hinge  Thought it was surely a joke- I have no beef with anyone  nothing inappropriate  long term user and verified profile  Thought surely something got reported by mistake and I asked for appeal and it was denied   I m permabanned  I ve seen reports now that I m looking about this happening and how much their appeal process sucks and that they ll recognize me if I try to make a new profile  What do I do   Has anyone had this happen to them    I m on Bumble at least but   I just can t understand this  And can t fathom what I could ve done to warrant this  It s so frustrating that their support all seems to be automated and final 
Reddit,Fake Profiles,This just happened so I thought I d share  Matched with a lady on Hinge today and started chatting  I was suspicious at first cause her pictures were too perfect  But I m a sucker so my disbelief was suspended  Then I commented about the NFC AFC title games and her reply was strange and generic  Then she disappeared  She recently reappeared and when I asked her a question  her reply came in Chinese then she realized her mistake  unmatched and disappeared  I don t understand why there are fake Chinese people on Hinge

Reddit,Hinge - Age Issue,Is anyone else having an issue lately with Hinge  suggesting people way out of your age range  I m in my   s and have my age preference set for   -   and for weeks now I m constantly getting guys on my feed that are either   -   or over     I thought it was a weird glitch the first day I noticed but it s been a while now  Is this happening to anyone else 
Reddit,Ceasing conversations,So I m pretty new to online dating and have a history of people pleasing issues that make it difficult  I have to keep reminding myself I owe nothing to a stranger I met on the internet other than basic kindness  I matched with someone  we only messaged a few times but I was already pretty sure it wasn t a good match  He didn t understand a joke I made and then got mad about it for some reason  I sent him a message basically saying I wasn t feeling it and I hope he finds what he s looking for  That pissed him off  So what s the best way to stop talking to someone  Just unmatching seems a bit rude to me unless they said something offensive or creepy  What would you rather be on the receiving end of 
Reddit,Should I give him my number ,So I ve been talking to this man for a few months now and he s asked me on a date and he wants to exchange numbers  We haven t met yet    I really like him and he s been so sweet  and I feel comfortable getting to know him more  If it goes south I can block him right    Am I overthinking or is it too soon   Any advice would be great 
Reddit,What is your success rate after the other person reschedules ,I ve been on OLD for many years and had several dozen first dates  My cold hard stats  after a girl reschedules  the chance of us ever meeting again is about      and the chance that we re gonna have anything happen between us is practically nil  even if I manage to take her out after a reschedule  I reckon this is due to the fact that a reschedule implies she isn t too interested and she also doesn t respect my time   A shocking bonus fact  many people advise that I should be ok if she is very proactive in setting up another date  or she only postpones to tomorrow  My experience is that this doesn t change the stats  As soon as she types the word  reschedule   our fate is sealed   My data includes excuses like sickness  sudden work assignments  tiredness  sleepiness etc  People are also very protective of sickness as a good excuse but all girls who got  sick  before our date ended up never meeting me after   What are your stats  I m not asking about the one exception where your neighbor met his wife this way  I m asking general stats  Because I m kinda ready to conclude that at this point when I read the word reschedule  I ask no questions  negotiate nothing  just unmatch right away 
Reddit,Everytime I match with a guy  we talk  then they just seem to shut me out ,Last night I matched with this guy on Okcupid  and we were talking about meeting up  just for a hookup  We even exchanged numbers  But for some reason  like five minutes later  he blocks me  I don t hear anything back  A couple hours later  I decided to match with a guy who sent me a message on Bumble  we talked for about an hour  but we couldn t meet up because neither of us had a ride  and it was a four and a half hour walk  I gave him my number  and we agreed to meet up in the morning  since the buses would be back up  I check on him in the morning  since I forgot to turn on Bumble s notifications  and he ended our chat  Am I doing something wrong  Why do people keep blocking me 
Reddit,Why do so many Chinese ladies change their location to my city , I swipe right  we match  and guess what  Their profile says they actually live in Thailand or the Philippines  There s no chance I m going to fly to one of the Chinese countries just for a date  Is there a way to avoid this      x   B 
Reddit,How do unphotogentic people navigate making a profile ,People who struggle to take decent photos  I am extremely unphotogenic 
Reddit,Is  open minded  just code for sex hook ups ,Title  What are your thoughts  Guy I was supposed to see said he wanted a serious relationship  Day before our date  he s asking me if we can go to his house for sex  we ve already unmatched but I remember he used the word  open minded  in his profile when he was talking about some qualities he looks for  I m not looking for sex on the first date or hook ups so I m wondering if I should avoid anyone who uses this in their profile  I feel every time I see that term it alludes to sex    Obligatory I know not EVERYONE who uses that term just wants sex but I m wondering if the majority do 
Reddit,How are dating sites apps worth so much money ,After watching a clip of the founders of Coffee Meets Bagel turn down     million in cash on Shark Tank which was shocking to me  I was also shocked to learn it s current Net Worth is      million dollars and it generates     million in revenue annually  It doesn t seem to do anything quite different than other dating apps and quite frankly from my and other friends experience  it would seem it has the same disappointing experience for the average man  Studies show that women only match with the top    of men on dating apps  I don t even know how dating apps make a lot of money  Most guys who pay for premium services would quit after a month or   of no matches and women don t need to pay for matches  Plus I and most guys I know have given up on dating apps and deleted from their phones  How are dating apps still doing so well  Is it just relying on a constant stream of new guys who pay for a few months of premium before quitting 
Reddit,How to cancel a date,I ve met someone online and he seems really nice but I ve realised I m not ready for anything yet  We have never met but have a date planned for tomorrow  I don t want to waste any more of his time so how can I tell him  nicely without seeming like I don t care 
Reddit,Leaving  are we dating the same guy ,There s been some post about this  but it s been several months ago  The last few days I decided to leave these groups because I noticed these patterns that just keep appearing over and over and it s the same women who did the same men and it s all just some weird immature game   When you look at these women s profiles who post these guys they have heavily filtered photos of themselves  They are so not even being real with themselves    And then I just got so disgusted  If I heard one more we matched  we are chatting  or  he has been posted before    I am literally going to barf   I m embarrassed that I ever even joined the groups in the first place  I am also embarrassed that I ever even signed up for online dating and dating apps in the first place as well   These groups just exposed  how toxic the entire dating app industry is  A lot of people don t realize that Tinder etc  was started by so-called incels who are incredible coders app developers   who never got any play and decided this is a great way for me to get some pussy   It s taking me a very long time to realize this because I was so caught up in it  but I have absolutely no desire anymore to be part of these groups or even dating apps  Anyway  that s just my rant for the day   if anyone is thinking of getting out of this mess  this is your sign 
Reddit,Inviting a person back to your place ,So I m  f   new to online dating and I m extremely careful  one of the girls my family used to babysit was murdered and met her murderer off tinder so I m super sketched out anyway  but I met this guy one day and went to an arcade which was a blast  but now he wants to come to my house this weekend and it turned me off  Is that a typical expectation  I don t like someone I barely know coming to my house seeing where my kids sleep  etc but my friends are saying I m paranoid    Thanks 
Reddit, I want to see more photos of you  and then ghosting,Lol I never understood this thing that some women tend to do  They will get your phone number  and will ask you to send them more pictures of yourself to confirm if you re a  catfish   Lol  this happened to me  I sent the girl some pictures that weren t my best per say  nothing unappealing though  It s just that my best photos are on Hinge   and then she ghosted me after having some pretty good convos beforehand   I understand the whole online dating thing is superficial because you are literally judging people off their photos  but asking me for more photos and then ghosting me is hilarious lmaooo  Like I literally look like the same guy  Idk  I never understood this phenomenon because as a man  I only have so few good pictures  I get told I look better in person all the time lol  But honestly  I think she just had a ton of dudes hitting her up and wanted to find a way to weed somebody out lol  Only logical solution I can think of at least

Reddit,When you match with someone and message them  how long are you willing to wait for a first response from them ,There are no right or wrong answers here  I m just curious about the different views and thoughts on it    With me personally  it tends to be at least    hours    After matching  I  almost always  immediately say hi and mention what I liked in their profile  and ask about something related to it  I only try to talk to a maximum of three people at a time to avoid social burnout  In that regard  I definitely appreciate quality over quantity  but also don t want to waste precious time   I was wondering how long others here wait before giving up and unmatching  What are your reasons for either unmatching or sticking around for a while

Reddit,Explanation on how The League works ,So I joined The League s waitlist last week  didn t really start looking through the app until today  I m not really sure how it works still what I m mainly wondering is  when have I well and truly joined the dating pool  Does that require you to be a paid member  or is it when you get off the waitlist   Also  can someone explain how I jumped multiple thousands of spots up the waitlist in a day  It says I m    globally and locally now is it a visual glitch 
Reddit,Am I in a minority for wanting to skip the BS ,So I ve had a lot of potential dates  But I tend to blow it  I don t like texting  I find it fake  easy to miscommunicate  and time consuming  So usually request to  atleast  video chat within the first couple messages    If not actually meet for coffee or something    I ve noticed some will block me right after I ask that   like  isn t that why your on here  to meet someone       My logic  the fact that we matched should be enough to go on a casual date   Texting is pointless because anyone can  pretend  over text   I have wasted too much time  texting  potential online dates and now have a phone book full of people I never met before  so yeah either hang out or FaceTime until comfortable  Doesn t sound unreasonable to me       
Reddit,How to approach this girl about a relationship ,I    m  matched with a girl on hinge about   weeks ago  Since then we have been texting every day  FaceTimed multiple times and even went on a date  On our date we even talked for   hours and I really felt a connection  Unfortunately she moved back to school last week so I won t see her for a while  We still text and FaceTime all the time but she never flirts with me or anything when talking  Its like talking to a friend in a way  which isn t what I want  Again  we only went out once bc she left for school so I don t think I should expect anything from her  But why does she still want to text and FaceTime often  What should I do in this situation  any advice would be useful 
Reddit,Why do people just accept a like or match and not initiate conversation ,I don t understand  is that how the online dating world is   If you like someone s profile  they like back and that s it  Are they expecting the other person to always to start the conversation- the person who liked them first  Am I the only one who is finding this odd    As a very normal  ordinary looking women I find that strange  if someone doesn t like you and not interested then just don t match or unmatch if clicked by mistake     Talking about a non bumble world 
Reddit,How can I be less boring with messages ,I    m  do not usually get a lot of matches  but I got   last week    I tried different approaches in messaging but I feel I am too boring  I will always ask a question after responding to their question  I also tried asking for a date in my second or third message  I also tried changing the intervals in which I respond  e g   responding right away  waiting   minutes  waiting an hour or longer    None of the above has helped keep interest  Looking back at my messages  I think I just respond in an awkward way  that s why I try to lock in a date quick  But this also scares off people    Does anyone have tips on how to keep people interested or be less boring over text but not too pushy or needy 
Reddit,Would this be too creepy ,I live in a very rural area  circles are small  even if you don t know someone  you probably know somebody that does know them or they know someone that knows them   I joined POF awhile ago again  to maybe try to date again   Not a lot has caught my interest   Even though I don t pay  they have the blurred photos when someone  viewed and liked you   and being there aren t many choices on there locally  I can pretty much tell most of the profiles that did that from the local profiles   One gal has caught my eye  and she has  viewed and liked  me a couple times the past few months I have been on there  problem is  she has disabled messages   By chance  I noticed we have a mutual  friend  on Facebook   This  friend   we aren t close  she is actually just someone I took out one time and we never went anywhere   Edit  For clarification  the gal from POF commented on one of this friend s posts  that s how I saw her profile on FB   Would it be creepy if I reached out  respectfully  explained why I was messaging through there  and struck up a conversation   I m worried I ll come off as stalkerish or a guy that just randomly messages women on Facebook to try and hook up 
Reddit,Pickup lines or formal greetings ,When I am swiping through these dating apps and get a few matches  I will usually say something along the lines of    Hey  How are you    Goodmorning        ask about something on their profile   I rarely get a response but when I do it s boring  dry  one word  one sided conversation    What are some strategies you guys use to get more communication from women on dating apps   Ratio - Match with       respond     completed
Reddit,Possible scam ,About a week ago  I matched with a girl from FB dating  We went from fb messaging to messaging on instagram  she did ask for either WhatsApp or insta     days into texting  she asked permission if we could video chat  I figured why not  it s also for security purposes and to make sure it s not some old dude behind the screen  She does look like what she shared on her profile  So far  so good right  Now here s the questionable part     days into texting and she managed to worked crypto into the conversation  Saying how she s both trading in crypto on the side while working full time  Cool  more income sources the better  But then she tried to convince me to get into crypto  She showed me how much she made and was doing her  sales pitch  on why crypto is good   She sent links from crypto com and she ll guide me step by step  Luckily I didn t clicked any links she sent  I managed to talk her down and said I m not interested in it    On day    she brings up crypto again and I again shot her down  Then she went on full guilt tripping text about how I wasnt capitalizing on this opportunity to make more money and not willing to learn new stuff  This raises a huge red flag for me right away    We ve been texting for   days and did two video calls  She s also conveniently located in Singapore now  Is this a possible scam 
Reddit,No dates more than a week in advance,I    M  started applying a rule to make my old more efficient and wanted a second opinion  If I have good text banter with someone  and we had been texting for several days to a week  I ll ask her out  and if the answer is anything but a  yes  this week  I m out   With one exception below    My experience is that no one is so busy that they have something to do in the next   consecutive days  And the girls who really wanna meet you will make it easy  the rest of the juice is not worth the squeeze  Literally every date I set up more than a week in advance  no matter the excuse  sickness included  ended in last minute cancellation or generally low interest that wasn t enough to have good dates  On some rare occasions I managed to get the more reluctant girls out  and every time it proved to be a waste of time - either they don t look as good as the profile or they are actually pretty but still acting uninterested on the date  The one exception is if they provide a good excuse and they sound like they actually really regret not having time this week  I just turned one down who we had really good banter with  but I asked her out Tuesday morning and she said  it s too short notice  what s next week like   I told her I don t schedule this long ahead anymore  she got butthurt  I stopped replying and she unmatched me  Sorry bro but you can t completely fail to convey any interest at such a critical point in the interaction as when I ask you out  Even if the banter was amazing  this is the very first time when she can prove that she actually wants to meet  so I judge these few texts very harshly  I also don t wanna spend another week texting someone who has potentially low interest  On multiple occasions I told the girl I m only on board if it s this week and it turned out they were actually free tomorrow and the day after    lol  Am I too harsh 
Reddit,Make up and filters false advertising  ,Most women you see out an about have some form of makeup on    However most do their makeup really nice for app photos and social media    Now if you look at these side by sides  one  https   ibb co MSdC  N   two  https   ibb co  cfwXkT   Now both of these women look mostly different and thats just make up granted it s not the lazy method of using filters    I m not even gonna dive into plastic surgery or clothing designed to make her ass look bigger  boobs looks bigger  and waist and tummy appear slim     Now is this fair to men  That you portray yourself on apps one way but outside the apps at home you look like completely different people      Now before anyone comes in here saying men can do the same thing    Men are just now getting stuff to artificially enhance perception    Shoes that give you  -  inches in height and you can t tell it s the shoes    Men have limited shape wear   bald men get shit for having a toupee or trying to make the hair work     Anyways what s your thoughts on this and is it false advertising
Reddit,I may be too old for this,I m    years young and have never had to find a date this way   I ve probably had a profile for   weeks   I felt like I put a thorough and honest bio together with real  unfiltered pictures   An effort that I believe shows I m trying   I am honestly shocked at the lack of effort people put into their profile let alone read mine   I know what I want and don t want   I am too old not too know what I want at this point   I do not want a casual relationship   Do I want to get married tomorrow  absolutely not - maybe never   My political stance is liberal   Yet for some unknown reason I keep getting likes from Christian conservatives who want friendship  casual or  not sure    Seriously  we will not get along  man      No picture  or possibly the worst picture ever   no bio or it s   words long -  ask me anything      Come on  put in some effort   Also  why is living in the PNW only finds me men who like to show me their dead fish and elk      Honestly  I feel like another male fisherman or hunter might think that is cool   I m all for having a hobby but I want to see who you are not your dead trophy s   I could honestly go on and on     I am sure men have similar horror stories   But am I the only one    
Reddit,Younger men older women ,Ok  here is my question ye o  wise Reddit community  Help a sister understand   I m a conventionally attractive   f  and do look young for my age  I have always maintained a tight age range on the lower end for dating apps  and haven t really considered dating anyone much younger than myself   I have several single girlfriends in my age range    s and early   s   and a recent conversation with my girlfriends got me thinking about this  with one woman    f  currently dating a   m  No judgement but I can t imagine myself ever dating that young  However  I did expand my age range down a little and I m getting a bunch of likes from            year old men   I m really hoping to find a connection and eventually serious relationship    What do we all think about this  Are these young guys in their mid   s actually interested in dating women in their early   s  Are they serious  Are they old enough  Are they just looking for hookups  Is this more risky that they re just compromising on the apps to get a match but prefer someone closer to their own age  What are they thinking    I m not sure what I think about this  Please help me understand  Thank you      
Reddit,Long-Distance Internet Romance first meeting  Seeking Advice,Three years ago  I matched with a guy from the UK on eHarmony while on a free trial   I live in the US   We initially connected over our shared interests and felt a strong connection but I kinda distanced myself because  well  the distance  So we kept in touch intermittently while pursuing other relationships  Recently  we reconnected and realized our feelings for each other are stronger than ever  We ve been in constant communication  primarily through FaceTime and are quickly becoming best friends  We both admitted we are falling for each other    He s now planning to visit me for two weeks next month   Edit  staying with me at my place   This is where I need advice  I have never been in a long-distance relationship before  or one that started online  and the thought of transitioning our virtual connection into the real world is both exciting and daunting  I m authentic so I m not worried about that  more so worried about what if we don t feel the connection once he is here  What if I shut down  There is so much pressure with meeting someone for the first time in person and then them staying with you for two weeks   I m reaching out for advice or personal experiences from those who have been in similar situations  How do you navigate the transition from an online to an in-person relationship  especially with the added complexity of long-distance  Any insights or tips would be greatly appreciated   Edit  end goal  we have discussed what happens if things go well  I would move there after a year of us both going back and forth

Reddit,Facebook Dating  for friends ,During the last few years I ve used Facebook Dating  it s been among the worst OLD apps I ve used and not deleted   Now Facebook has implemented this Friends aspect of the app and I ve been connecting with women  seeing more interesting women than I ve seen on the dating side of the app  I am genuinely looking at them in the friends context  The first one I ve actually struck up a conversation with pretty quickly just asked me what I am doing one evening this week  Seems like she wants to date  Has anyone experienced this   When I see the  Friends  profiles  they look indistinguishable from dating profiles in their presentation  This seems reasonable because I have not been asked by the app to create a different profile  I guess I am just wondering if people are using this side of the app to connect with people romantically despite it being a Friend connection  What has your experience been

Reddit,Dating multiple people at once,Hello  I    F  am very new to the online dating world  recently out of a LTR  and need some advice   I ve been talking to a few people and I ve never been in the position where l ve had good conversations with more than one person or dating more than one  Until now  I typically go for quirky  nerdy guys and will date one person at a time  but I am talking to   guys currently  Tony  Jay  and Carter   I m not looking to jump right into a serious relationship but I am open to it if the right person comes along  I ve never had a casual relationship either which I m also open to   I had a first date with Tony earlier on in the week and there was a lot of making out and physical chemistry  We didn t sleep together but I have a feeling it could happen on the second or third date  I m not sure if he s someone I d date seriously  or if l m someone he d date seriously  and I get the vibe that he s the possessive clingy type  Conversation kinda died off as soon as things got more physical  We have a second date planned for the end of this week   I had a phone conversation with the second guy  Jay  which was great and we have a date scheduled for next week to finally meet in person  He seems really interesting and we have a lot in common and I m hoping we get along in person   I had another first date with Carter who was very sweet and we shared a kiss at the end of the night  He seems really kind and considerate and I think my attraction will build for him  He s been in consistent contact which has been nice without it being overwhelming    I m just not sure how to go about dating multiple people  Do I tell them I m seeing others and not in a rush for a relationship  or ask them what they re looking for  whether it s casual or not   Do I assume that they re sleeping with other women  I don t want to hurt anyone so should I hold off on sleeping with anyone until I think it s something that can be exclusive  Am I supposed to cut contact with everyone else if I decide to sleep with someone

Reddit,I am not sure if I should continue having conversations with this guy ,I find myself in an uncertain circumstance with this person  a situation that has persisted since our initial conversations  Understanding his intentions is not always clear  and he appears reluctant to reveal much about himself despite the information he has shared with me  I recognize that this uncertainty may stem from various barriers inherent in online communication  such as the lack of intonation and emotions  differences in our communication styles  or potential cultural and language discrepancies    For example  I mentioned that I worked hard to learn Chinese in my childhood  and he responded by saying   You were a good student or you found Chinese challenging  not sure what you mean   Everything seemed fine until he added  not sure what you mean   Although unhappy I responded   I was diligent at the moment because learning Chinese is always time-consuming and challenging to some people  In my opinion  it s harder than English if you want to master Chinese   He said  That s fair  Interesting  I m not familiar so I can t rate it  It s dissimilarity to English makes it naturally challenging for someone with only knowledge of a language that originates from Latin   I was not referring to him learning Chinese  it s about my experience as you all know    It s hard to make him resonate with me  There are instances where I initiate a conversation with a general statement without providing a thorough explanation  and his response gives the impression that I didn t explain myself clearly  which is quite upsetting  English is not my mother tongue  so every time he expresses uncertainty about what I mean  I wonder if my English is not good enough or our communication has some issues    He often comments on my personality  saying things like  you seem too upbeat  when I said I need to prepare for an exam or  you appear conservative   attempting to analyze me  Moreover  he expresses a liking for this particular aspect of my personality  Frankly  I m not keen on having my mind read and being liked solely based on someone else s preferences  I prefer more engaging and interactive conversations   Given my limited dating experience  this guy appears somewhat reliable  as he  at his age  is seeking a life partner  aligning with my goals  Yet  I am uncertain whether to continue our conversations or move on to the next person  Our interactions generally lack humor or excitement  and at times  I find myself frustrated or confused  I haven t met this person yet but not much will change if he behaves always this way  Please advise   Thanks

Reddit,Current match experience - ask for a video call asap,I matched on Hinge with a guy  He had a cute dog and first red flag was that he said he will get rid of him because of time management  We switched to WhatsApp    After a day of sharing about each other he writes this   I have to tell you that you re the first person I ve met on the site who really wants to be serious  and I d like you to be the last if you feel the same way I do  The important thing for me is that we get to know each other first  and if we can build our paradise just for the two of us and our children  that would be great  I noticed in your writings sincerity and simplicity which struck me  I hope to bring you the joy of love  Are you really up for a true story     I respond saying we should video chat the next day  Long story short  on video chat I get played a loop video of him half naked  holding the dog  with a big smile on  I ask him why I can t see him through the camera  we drop the call  try again  same story  apparently bad connection  In writing I tell him I couldn t see anything and that I want a video of him  He sends me the exact same video again  I pretend I don t get what is going on  cause I hoped to get him to talk on the phone at least but I didn t send him a video in return so he got cold feet    Ladies and guys who are on online dating platforms  please demand a video call as soon as possible  a real person or someone who doesn t have anything to hide will video chat with you anytime  Please be safe and don t send money to anyone who you did not meet irl  at least  
Reddit,Are They Putting Off Meeting or Am I Being Rejected ,I matched with someone on a dating app a few months ago  We both kinda drifted apart bc initially he said he didn t think we were compatible and he popped back up again a month later to say sorry  He said if he s ever in my side of town  can he get in touch  He has a brother who lives here  I told him yes  We live about    mins away but in the same state  Then he mentioned that he could probably see me Thurs or Friday and asked how my schedule looked those days  I said I m free so those days work  I assumed he was mentioning coming up that week but I heard nothing from him  It wouldn t have happened anyway bc we got snow  but what bothered me is him not saying anything  I ve offered to come to his side of town in the past but it seems he rather come to me  So I sent him a text on Monday  being light hearted asking what happened to him  He responds the following evening     hrs later  with  I promise I will let you know when I m up there   I left it on  read      So is it safe to assume that response is rejection or should I show some grace and consider that maybe they have a lot going on in their life atm  Never had this issue before ever  Most times I meet someone and always leads to another date or meet up  Just seems weird to me that in the beginning they were big on meeting right away and now it seems like an almost impossible   I guess I just need clarity or closure because I m planning to communicate my disappointment in their ways and block them so they can stop reaching back out

Reddit,Is there a site app besides HIKI ,I m a   M with autism  and unfortunately the only app or site for people with autism  or who are neurodivergent  that I know of  is HIKI   which just doesnt work unless you re american  Are there any sites or app that cater to or are autism nsurodivergent friendly 
Reddit,Getting back into dating  but I attract the wrong intent ,EDIT  I didn t make this post to generalize  Dating is tough for every gender  and I don t think that men are the problem  no one particular group is  I just was asking to clarify on my own actions and get advice on how to do better    So I m a    year old female and recently decided to start using the apps  It sucks  but nothing insane I guess   My biggest problem is that I keep getting people intent on a one-night stand rather than a date  My profile lists my intentions as  serious long term relationship  and I only swipe on men that match that  My pictures are not sexual  My prompts and about me are more personality and interest responses  But I still keep getting dudes who kind of avoid the romantic interest and move into sexual  I get it  we re all thirsty out here  I love sex as much as the next person  But I want to be wooed and courted a little  What am I doing wrong  Men  is this just normal  I don t know   I also am not overly flirtatious or trying to have sex immediately  I get enough sex and have been so tired of the hookups  hence  the apps  I m reasonably attractive but nothing mindblowing  I just wanna date lol  I just want to find love and keep it 
Reddit,Date invites ignored,So we matched on tinder and during the initially got her to be interested to get a sorbet during a conversation about sweets  However  neither of us were free that week and the coming one as well  In the meantime  conversation is good and things look good  Now when I try to bring that up again she just continues the conversation while ignoring my date invites  I know I must act as if it did not happen but how do I proceed from here 
Reddit,Dating Apps Don t Work for me,Hey fellow Redditors   I ve been wrestling with my experience on dating apps and could use some input  It s challenging to articulate  but I ve noticed that the people I ve genuinely felt a connection with weren t necessarily conventionally attractive or out of this world interesting  There was however this elusive spark  an instant connection that made the process of getting to know them feel effortless  These people I have always met in person    It seems like dating apps simply do not work for me  It s impossible for me to find that unique spark in initial conversations since its online  How does one reckon with translating that intangible chemistry into online dating   Has anyone else felt this way  I d love to hear your thoughts and experiences  Let s delve into the complexities of dating and share insights 
Reddit,Is it normal to pretend like you don t know things that were explicitly on my profile ,I just started online dating not too long ago so I ve been on two dates with two different girls and in conversation both of them asked a question that I figured was already know based on the answer being on my profile    For example   Girl A asked if I liked dogs and if I had one  Well my first picture is literally me with my dog    Girl B asked what my age was  Again obviously that s on my profile   Is this normal for being to pretend like they don t know or were they really that oblivious 
Reddit,Zoomer women making their entire personality being mentally ill,So many of women s dating profiles have  crazy   delusional   batshit crazy  on them and nothing else  They want to soley market themselves as mentally ill for some reason  and have that be their only discernible personality trait  It comes across as fake - people with actual mental health issues don t flaunt it and romanticize it  In terms of how dating profiles social media work - you market yourself as how you want to be PERCEIVED rather than actuality - so it really irks me that people want to be perceived as mentally ill   Zoomers in particular think it s   cool  and  edgy   They see being mentally stable and healthy as not cool    And these women aren t even delusional a lot of the time  like none of these women have schizophrenia or psychosis  lol they re   delusional   in the sense that they freak out when hot men don t pay attention to them and string them along  It s not like they re out here actin like Terry Davis
Reddit,Stir app just a big scam ,Noticed most profiles I m seeing have peculiar prompt answers  that other profiles use verbatim  spelling mistakes and emojis exactly the same  ie  same prompts  different name  stats  pics   The thing is  it seems really pervasive on this app  I ve also matched and chatted with some of these profiles  and they can talk convincingly like a local real person for about an hour before going silent forever  Some I even schedule dates with that flake  but only later find another profile with thier  exact  same prompts and answers   I haven t seen any discussion on this so  am I just new and this is a known part of OLD  Are these AI bots or super catfishes using multiple profiles or what  Does Match pay people in metro locations to pretend to be women  in hopes of upping paid conversions 
Reddit,BASED ON LOOKS,What is something someone can say on a profile  and then highlight the lie to make it more self presentable on a profile  Like a woman who might be overweight  will put  curvy   Since its online dating  we dont have to be completely honest  since they aren t seeing as in person right away  so their perceptions are just based off what we show  So what are some other exmaples  What would a guy put  
Reddit,Bumble -  Your Move ,I m new to online dating and am on   different apps  eharmony  FB and Bumble    I started a conversation with a guy last night and after a while I felt like I was carrying the entire conversation   Several quick answers to my questions but no question back   I m assuming he s at least someone interested as we matched   However  he had a one word response to one of my questions and by the end of the night I just got bored and signed off for the night   Now the app says it s  My Move     I read that you have    hours to respond initially  but does this match expire after    hours once the conversation starts   Is he able to respond even though it s my move or does the app only allow a back and forth dialogue   Ugh   Now I know why people complain about using dating apps 
Reddit,I deleted Tantan after my first two matches were scammers,Is this reasonable  The first one was some kind of escort  probably a fake one  and the second one I thought we were having a pretty genuine conversation but then after a few hours she wanted me to buy crypto  After barely over    hours I gave up on the app 
Reddit,How long would you say is average in between messages ,Ive been OLD for maybe a week and ive had a couple matches but one thing im noticing is if someone texts me back I ll normally reply within the hour max like   hours if im working but then they ll take a day to reply or I ll message them in the morning and they ll reply about    hours later  Sometimes I ll talk to someone in real time late at night but that s not often  Is this just standard for OLD or am i just not making interesting enough conversations
Reddit,RULES Update   Read before posting or commenting ,As the amount of spam  nonsense posts  unnecessarily rude comments  etc  has increased and we ve been banning   -    users a day  we felt it was a good time to review some of the rules and guidelines for posting and commenting here  PLEASE note  like in most other large subs  violating these rules typically results in a  permanent ban    they are clearly posted here  please do not send us a modmail after the fact saying you did not know the rules  we spend countless hours moderating the sub  we don t need to work even harder because you couldn t take a few minutes before posting to read the rules    First off  since this is a common modmail issue we get    NOTICE FOR NEW USERS    We use automod to filter out new accounts and those with low karma due to the number of new accounts being used to create rule-breaking posts  If you are a new user or have low karma and your post or comment does not appear you likely do not have enough karma or enough days on reddit  Please wait until you have been on reddit and built up karma    With that said when posting here  there are a few things you should think about    A    First  is this post relevant to online dating  this is a place of encouragement and support for online dating users  not a place to bash online dating  ask about things irrelevant to online dating  or go off on a rant  etc    B    Second  will this post help the community  This is a community-minded forum  not your personal soap box or diary  Posts should be questions that are beneficial to the community and help others learn   posts that are simply rants  have no purpose  serve no point  appear more like a diary entry or don t ask a relevant question shouldn t be posted here  Posts should form a question that users can answer    C    Third  please do not ask nonsense  silly or unanswerable questions  Questions should be things random strangers can give an informed opinion on   asking why a match hasn t replied  why you can t get matches  why someone blocked you  etc  should be avoided as no one here can answer why a random stranger isn t interested in you    D    Fourth  this is not a dating sub  a make friends sub or a profile review sub  This is not the place to seek dates or friends or to have your dating profile reviewed    When commenting here  there are a few things you should think about    E    First  please be respectful with your comments  Other users may have different opinions  but please be considerate  This is especially true for top-level comments   please do not antagonize people who have posted a top-level comment just because you disagree with it    F    Second  we try to be fair and equal to everyone  however we seem to have a number of users who call users names  call another user sexist or misogynist  etc  This is not acceptable    G   Third  comments should give an opinion relevant to the post or answer the question in the post  Comments which don t directly answer the question should be avoided    In addition to the above  some of more important rules to remember are as follows          The purpose of this sub is to discuss online dating   issues with apps  questions about app or dating experiences  questions about profile setup  questions about dating experiences  etc  It is NOT a sub to find dates or to post your dating profile  This sub would be cluttered as could be if everyone were to post looking for dates  additionally  it s unlikely many people on here would be anywhere near you geographically anyway         Similarly  do NOT post referral links  surveys  affiliate links  ask for referrals  promote yourself  spam  etc  This is not the place to ask for or post your links to join a dating site  referrals to a dating app  etc  This is not the place to promote yourself  your business  your app  your subreddit  your website  etc  Absolutely no surveys  school surveys  etc          Please be considerate of others and their opinions  It s understandable that different users may have different views and that is fine  but there have been a few  troll  accounts that have gone around doing nothing but posting rude comments for no real reason  This will not be tolerated  Be considerate of others  avoid foul language  do not antagonize or call others names and avoid being rude to others  Additionally  while it is wonderful if you make friends here  please be mindful of other users privacy   many post on here for opinions and comments  not to make friends or find a date  Please do not ask posters to  DM  you or provide you with their contact information  etc  Many users are not interested in corresponding outside of the sub and that should be respected        Posts here are open to all users to answer  Please do not attempt to limit what users may answer  Posts that state  women only    men only    older daters only  etc  are not acceptable          No guides  articles  tips and tricks or how-tos  This is not the place to post guides  opinion pieces  advice  tips and tricks  articles  essays  advice columns  etc  Additionally  posts should not be needlessly long or appear more like an essay than a question        No nonsense  silly or unanswerable questions  Posts here should ask a question that a random stranger would be able to answer   Questions that a stranger can not be reasonably expected to answer such as  Why did my match block me    Why didn t my date want to meet again    Why don t I get matches   Should I use dating apps    What is the best app to use    Is OLD a good idea   etc  should not be asked         Similar to     posts should be a question which have some purpose or point  While complaining is one thing  if your post is better suited for r rant  it will probably be removed  Posts which are nothing but venting or ranting or appear more like a diary entry may be removed        Similar to     if you don t have good experiences with or don t like online dating  fine  However  as this is r onlinedating  we like to have a welcoming and open atmosphere towards online dating  not to scare people away from it  Posts saying that online dating sucks  is terrible  shouldn t be used  that people should  get outside and get off online dating   etc  should not be made  Likewise  repeatedly making these types of comments also is not acceptable  An occasional comment here or there that is critical about online dating is fine  but this is a sub to support and help people who use online dating  not to discourage them       No antagonizing users who post top level comments  If someone posts a top-level comment and you have a differing opinion  please respect their comment  You can post your own top-level comment  however  picking a fight  and antagonizing someone else for their own opinion in a top-level comment should be avoided        No  one and done profile reviews  or help make my profile posts  In general the idea of the sub is to be a place that others can learn from and a place that benefits others and not just the OP  In that spirit and because of the number of people that have been posting  profile review  posts or asking for help creating a profile  in general these are not allowed  These posts clutter the sub  are beneficial only to the OP and in many cases it is the only post the OP makes here  If a user is a regular user of the sub and is seen often helping other posters  we will consider making an exception to this rule for them        This is not an AMA or sex sub  This should go without saying  but this is not an AMA sub for you to brag about how you got     dates in a month  etc  There are other subs dedicated to AMA s  Likewise  with the nature of online dating it is understandable that some sexual things may be mentioned in a post  however this should be limited to brief basic relevant details   there should be no in-dept sexual discussion nor should the post read more like a fantasy novel then a post relevant to the sub  Posts should be closer to PG then to R        Moderator Discretion  This is not one we wanted to add  but due to the number of banned users who modmail us and argue that what they did doesn t perfectly fit one of the rules we are going to add that the mods here have discretion as to if a post or comment is allowed or not and to ban or warn users   Sorry for the length  but with the amount of posts and comments we ve had to remove  we want to be clear what is acceptable here  If you have a question  please ask  With all that being said  WELCOME  Thanks for stopping by  And if you feel something violates the rules  remember to hit the REPORT button 
Reddit,Update ,I m pretty sure he blocked me lmfao   Like I said earlier I asked him for coffee this weekend just to see if he d actually go  This was at     ish am  It is now almost  pm and no response  So I texted him saying that I was going to take him not responding as an answer  I appreciated the conversation and I wished him the best    Message has not been delivered  Not even man enough to say no    It s honestly not a big deal because I kinda already knew it was going to end this way  Thanks everyone for giving helpful advice 
Reddit,Should I pay for his ticket if I cancelled ,Hello  I am a girl  and I recently started texting a guy on a dating app  and he seemed okay initially  and we decided to meet  So he offered to come to my city     minute train ride   and booked an advance ticket for      roughly       However  he started getting a bit weird as the meeting date approached  and I started feeling like we won t really get along   Even when we were planning the date  I asked him what cuisines he likes  and he told me he is open to anything  So I started looking up restaurants on Google  and he didn t exactly like any of the options  This went on for a bit  I then said we could go for pizza  so I suggested another restaurant  which he didn t like  Eventually  I suggested another cheap one that I didn t exactly want to go to  and he wanted to go there  I honestly wasn t feeling it by that point  so I cancelled and offered to pay him for his train ticket  However  now I m sitting here and wondering  am I obligated to pay him the full price of the ticket since he didn t get a refundable one   Sorry  I m clearly very inexperienced with dating and would love some honest advice  Thank you      UPDATE  I paid the full amount  lol  Thank you 
Reddit,My bad experiences with online dating  What am I doing wrong ,A few weeks ago  I posted this on another subreddit and I basically got laughed out the room with  skill issue   I thought maybe I d have more success here   So to give a bit of background context  I have been single for just over three years now  Back in       a friend recommended that I get Hinge  so I did  Now  I think I m a fairly attractive person  and have an excellent profile that has been fine tuned in my time  however in the two or so years I ve had the app  with many likes with comments given  I have only been on dates with  two people  The others have been lost to the void  or the accounts are fake   In my time of using the app  I have also noted the most common traits in a lot of the people who pop up    The  Unoriginals   who will always say the same things  including  I want to travel more    give me travel tips for X    I have never seen  popular film franchise     I love Disney   etc  I have tried talking to people like these and they cannot hold a conversation or have statements so generic I can t think of anything to reply with     Dead  accounts  people who left the app for one reason or another  but forgot to delete their profile  meaning you can still see their profile    Bots catfishers  people who use stolen pictures of models etc to make their account  trying to take advantage of people who are just looking for love  which I find incredibly cruel    The Gold-diggers  those who will not talk to you unless you earn seven figures  have a sports car  own a large house  etc  Sometimes  these accounts may be catfisher scammers    The Ghosters  they will match with you  talk to you for a bit and then go completely silent with no explanation    The non-talkers  who will match with you but cannot hold a conversation  and give really short answers like  good ty    nm hbu    k  etc   The Instagram pluggers  those who have something to the effect of  I don t look here often  talk me on Insta   The truth is  they don t want to talk to you  they are just farming followers  Also  these might even be bots  Any time I see one of these  I immediately pass    The  Pointless  accounts  which are rare but you do see them from time to time  Their pictures are just black squares  their prompt answers are either one word or a single       and have absolutely zero information about themselves  What s the point even being on the app if you evidently don t want to use it     That s a lot of things to red flag   you might think  and it is    I have tried everything  being reserved and straight up  I have done compliments and I ve been flirty  Nothing seems to work and I don t know what I m doing wrong  I m at an age where all my friends and acquaintances are starting to think about getting married and have families  whilst I m still single  It is really dealing huge blows on my mental health and self esteem    Am I doing anything wrong  or do I give up and try something else     TL DR   - I am having little success with online dating and I don t know what I am doing wrong 
Reddit,Matched with someone but I feel like it s a scam  ,Matched with someone recently on bumble and she said she likes mobile game and how she wants me to play with her    But she s asking about my phone and what not   and it feels sketchy   not sure I m paranoid about it but I experienced scammers before so I m not sure what s real or not   
Reddit,I ran through all the options on Bumble and Hinge  what other apps are good ,Hinge is by far my favorite dating app  the women I match with on there always match their pics  they have good heads on their shoulders  and the dates are enjoyable even if things don t click   Bumble is hit or miss  I don t get as many matches  and most of them don t send an intro message so the conversation never starts  When it does happen  the conversations are pleasant   What other dating apps are good  Match has been an overpriced experience with limited options  Tinder has creeps  and Plenty of Fish made changes the last few years that have made the app unusable  What apps do you use that lead to more dates 
Reddit,Keeps appearing on my notification so I might as well right   ,Online dating have never worked out for me  I either can t get a match for months or when I do it s a lady telling me  I m not ready I m just here to mingle   I ve tried being social  no luck everyone have someone  it s just me  I m    coming to     I see no hope for me  Hope the best of luck to you all this is my last year and probably my last tweet peace out 
Reddit,Profile with balding,So I have my profile with my best pictures but I started having crown balding as a male  I don t know how to show that in my profile so the person I date don t feel like I cat fished  My profile is updated with pictures from   weeks but that s only show in real life it s not possible in pic 
Reddit,She gave me her number then ghosted me,Why would someone give you their number on dating app after you had your first date and then ghost you after first message there 
Reddit,How to send perfect texts every time ,I ve always have the habit of writing down my text first and proofreading it multiple times before I send the text  to ensure I get the highest chances of getting a response back  It s similar to updating a rough draft for an essay  Basically I make sure that it s not too boring and that it doesn t weird the girl out  But I feel like even with putting in so much effort  sometimes the girl may just disappear right there and I never hear from them again  Or they do the slow fade  Sometimes even when I get a reply  it feels like pulling teeth since there s not much they give back or they don t ask questions in return  Either way  I ll regret the last text I sent and wonder that if maybe I sent something more interesting  then this wouldn t have happened   It feels like walking on eggshells  that one slight texting mistake and she s gone for good  Then I ll have to wait another few weeks for a good match to come in  just for the same thing to happen again  Even worse is that I ll start to run out of potential active profiles to swipe on in my area  So there is a bit at stake when it comes to texting  Do you have any tips on how to have the perfect text game  Does anybody proofread and overthink their texts too before sending them  Would love to hear your experiences too
Reddit,I kinda like him,We met on OLD and hit it right off    First date  We agreed to meet at a local bar and I got there first  but as I turned around to look  he walked in smiling  We hugged hello and found a little table  A couple of drinks and snacks later  we are laughing and enjoying ourselves  It goes by too fast and when it s time  he walks me to my car  We hug again and as we pull away  I placed a small kiss on his lips but it made him smile  Made me smile all the way home  too  I got home and there was a text from him thanking me for the date and asking me for another  I was over the moon and told him  yes of course    Second date  He told me to pick the place this time  I chose Vietnamese food and he wholeheartedly agreed  He picked me up from work and opened the doors for me  Very nice  We got there and drank a few Kirin and chatted about our day  Ate some delicious pho and decided to take an after dinner walk  We enjoyed our time  He took me home and this time he kissed me    One thing though   He never tries to hold my hand and I wish he would  Oh I need to tell you  there s a height difference of three inches  It doesn t bother me  and he said it doesn t bother him  I wear heels and he doesn t say a word  I guess I m just gonna go slow because this guy really sweet and kind and I would hate to push him   Third date  He just texted to say he wants to see me again soon  I mean aww  Yes  please  I wish I could help him feel more comfortable  Any ideas on how because I m really digging this little king  y all 
Reddit,Does it freak you out when a man seems overly into you before you ve even met in person ,I    F  have been chatting to a man    M  from on online dating app for a little less than a week  He seems sweet  fairly genuine   flirtatious  and we ve exchanged numbers  which I felt safe doing   He s been respectful and fun to chat with  but he s started calling me  babe  and  baby  even though I haven t called him those things  He s constantly hyping me up and saying how much he s enjoying our conversations so far  Tonight he sent me a goodnight text and he referred to me as his  future girlfriend     He seems lovely and him using babe baby future girlfriend have been the only things with him that s thrown me off  It s clear to me through our convos that he really wants a relationship  I do too  but I ve made it clear to him that I am not able to even be close to being in a relationship with someone without time   consistency over a few months of getting to know each other  He says he agrees  so I feel like he might just be getting excited and trying to flirt  My gut says that maybe he thinks this is how he feels he is supposed to flirt with women to come across as confident   What do you all think  Would this give you the ick and make you run the other direction  Or is this maybe his way of flirting connecting  Is it more common than I realize    To be clear  if we were actually in a relationship those terms wouldn t bug me  But we haven t met in person yet  and just started chatting  so it s giving me some pause 
Reddit,Am I just overthinking things ,Went on a fifth date with a girl I started talking to about a month ago on Bumble tonight  We hugged and kissed each other when we met up  Went really well  we had dinner and then went out to a barcade and got some drinks and played around for a good hour  Talked all the way to where I dropped her off  On the way there  we held hands and I told her that I liked her a lot and she reciprocated those feelings and then we hugged and kissed each other  We hugged and kissed each other goodbye  When i got home  she texted me  had a lot of fun tn     to which I responded  had so much fun      which she hearted  Then she said  we gotta hangout again soon  before saying goodnight  Is this a sign of her wanting to keep things casual or am I just overthinking things 
Reddit,Will someone disappear if the X you on Hinge ,Will someone disappear if they X you   There is this really attractive girl at the gym that I talk to all the time  we do some workout classes together  I kind of got a vibe if I wanted to shoot my shot it may work out for me  but haven t pulled the trigger      weeks ago I saw her on Hinge  I wasn t sure if it would be weird if I matched her  but didn t want to X her  so just closed the app and reshuffled  However  almost every day when I get to swiping she will eventually show up  I can only assume she sees me too   since she comes up so often for me   Is there a chance she just X d me and is just randomly coming up for me  Or is she likely not saying yes or no when I come up like I do her  I guess the other option is there are so many dudes on there she has never seen me hahaha 
Reddit,Dating apps sites that don t cost anythintg ,I m ok with h their being a premium option but I tried eharmony and it s ridiculous how much they charge just to use the chat   are their any that I can use without the subscription and still get a decent experience 
Reddit,I don t feel any excitement for anyone these days,I remember the last time I was on dating apps and found a few guys I was genuinely excited about on the first date  including my ex  These guys were amazing and treated me so well    Now I have been on and off the apps for almost   years and I just feel dead inside  I m not saying the guys I m matching with are bad because they are not  but I just can t seem to find anyone I feel a genuine connection with anymore in my late-   s  On top of it  I m finding more guys that just don t want something serious and it seems almost everyone is a fleeting bird that travels all the time    I don t really know what to think because although I am happy single  I also miss having a significant other to share things with  But I absolutely feel burnt out and am unable to find anyone in-person either 
Reddit,Thinking about an old on line thing,I wanted to write this long time but go was scared to feel judge    so   years ago i met a guy online   i was married  please dont judge   he was married aswell he lived in london i was in mexico at the time   we started chatting and then started talking on the phone and then we started face timing   we talked pretty Much every day by face time but he was such a men slut it was just like talking to a friend   although i was attracted to him so Much   we were facetiming non stop and he told me he was falling for me   i was falling for him aswell   but we were going no where as we were both married and so far away so   I decided to dissapear on him   i blocked him in everything  it was very hard   i missed my online friend      months after he texted me from a different number   i blocked him aswell   i still think of him from time to time but i dont know his full name i have his  old phone number but thats it    What can i do  
Reddit,Is it better to have a more  generic  profile ,I ve been curious about this lately and wanted to hear others  opinions  When I make my profiles I am always very clear on what my  admittedly niche  hobbies and interests are  in the hopes that I d attract someone with similar hobbies and interests  However  I don t get many matches for obvious reasons    I m wondering if it s better to make a profile more  generic  to attract the widest audience   How do you make your profiles  Interested in opinions from both men and women 
Reddit,is my mom getting catfished ,hi guys  my    f  mom    f  met this man on plentyofish a few days ago  and as she s been telling me about him  he seems too good to be true  his name is  David Williams   he s an international body guard for an oil company  makes over    k a year  and invests in bitcoin  i reverse image searched photos of him  and i m finding multiple accounts with his pictures  but different names  on websites ranging from wamba  mamba  topface  and list-vk  i ve never heard of any of these websites  and most of the accs are in russian  i know this seems pretty open and shut  but is there any other explanation that yall can think of   edit  alright i ve let her know  and she confronted him  but he s insistent that they video chat tomorrow over Skype  i told her i don t think it s a good idea  but if she does  she needs to send the link herself  and not click on anything he sends her  can she still get hacked in this way  praying to god she hasn t sent him money  but i m not above looking through their texts  
Reddit,Best app website ,I am looking to go international  Something leading up to something serious would be good  I am willing to pay for it as well  so long as the system works nicely   I was looking at a site called Rosebrides I think  and there were a lot of really nice and normal looking  intelligent women there  Any experiences are welcome of any sites and apps  Thanks 
Reddit,How to resist the urge to match way too many people ,I accidentally matched way too many people  and I don t know what to do now  This is my first time ever doing OLD  and I only went through a very small fraction of the people who swiped right on me  and just swiped right on everyone I liked  But I didn t think through the ramifications of that  and now there s no way I could have time to actually talk to all of these people  So I m just ghosting people left and right  and I feel like an asshole  And I m also constantly stressed that someone who could be a really good match is falling through the cracks because I m kind of just randomly focusing on three or four people I know little to nothing about because I don t have time to respond to everybody   And who knows if those  -  will ever even actually ask me on a date     The worst part is part of me wants to continue to go through people who right swiped me  which I know would only lead to more matches and is insane  But I can see that many of them are leaving messages and their blurred pictures look cute  and it s like part of me thinks I m missing the perfect person  and he s sitting right there and I ll never see it 
Reddit,How do you deal with the anxiety of a first date  ,I have to meet this guy tomorrow  by the way I already cancelled on him last week which wasn t really nice of me but I was too stressed out and said I had an emergency    Now he wants to get things moving and meet  I don t find an issue with that but  I m just not confident with my looks  He has seen beautiful pics of me in the past  so he probably assumes I m gonna be like that  Anyways  my other issue is that he s the type that cares a lot about his own appearance  He dresses very nicely  always tides his clothes  cleans his rooms  he s kind of too perfect in a way  But when we talk  I feel he s an open person  I have fun chatting with him    But you know  this happened to me before in the past  I meet these great guys  we talk for a while  i enjoy genuinely their company and during the date it s confirmed  but after they ghost me  So  I fear it will happen with him because well I think I have an idea what girl he would actually want to be coupled up with  a girl that dresses very nice is perfect physically etc    I don t he s the type to overlook flaws  which I have btw    So    I m not really feelin it tmw  I feel like I have to do it because I promised  But I have a feeling that I m gonna get judged again physically  And he s gonna notice my flaws and be so disappointed  It s uncomfortable for me to imagine that   EDIT  my pics are not filtered or old  and I m in shape  But I have a physical flaw that is not visible in my pics which is what concerns me  and I don t have the courage to show  
Reddit,I ve been ghosted after   dates   lmao, Well i m sad im kinda have a connection with this guy  as im dating others too  and I m glad i did lol So i met him on april last year long distance he ghosted me after   months of talking the only reasons we were talking is because i was moving to his city  So then i came here on december  he started talking to me  we had dates every weeks  sleepovers  really nice restaurants  he took care of me when i was sick  Last date he made me smoke a joint I was so hight i threw up and he felt bad since then he doesn t talk to me  and it hurt me because i was starting to have feelings for him  we were bonding last time  so why men are like this   should i send him a messages wishing to him happy birthday and giving him a closure  My ego it s hurt and i feel stupid nobody does that to me i feel so silly
Reddit,Have you ever messaged someone with a lazy profile and try to match their energy ,A simple example  their bio just says  hi  with a lot of extra padding so you just say  hi  back  and padding optional    Did you ever get a response from one   I actually did this a while ago on POF  They had a few pictures but the text area was just a string of random letters so I sent a string of random letters back  They never replied  Maybe it was a fake profile  who knows 
Reddit,Does long gaps between messages actually mean something ,I ve never come across a situation like this   I m chatting with this really nice girl and I think we d get a long but the thing that bothers me the most is how long it takes for her to respond  She s a GP so I get the job is stressful but   -   hours is just kind of ridiculous   I dunno what s on her side  is it like some sort of subtle way to tell me to fuck off  Is she just bad at reading messages on the app  Should I cut her loose  Should I ask why the delays 
Reddit,IRL Shallow Hal Brain Hack  PLZ ,I m wondering if anyone here has been successful with learning to be attracted to someone who they aren t physically attracted to  I can think a person is awesome  and love everything about them  but if I don t think they re pretty  hardware won t cooperate  I feel like I m missing out on women with real and interesting personalities  great senses of humor  really healthy life handling skills  nunchuck skills  Bo staff skills    all because I won t be able to enjoy the more nsfw activities with them  Any pointers 
Reddit,I don t understand why women do this ,I understand that nobody owes me anything and I also understand that not everyone is going to be into me  Having said that I m really sick and tired of women I meet on dating apps who seem super into me for a couple of days or a couple of weeks and then one day they just do a complete     and they start taking hours to reply  Maybe they re taking hours to reply to me and they re still on social media  The responses become shorter until one day they either just ghost me entirely  give me the I m not ready for a relationship speech or say what s been obvious ever since the energy changed which is they simply aren t interested   As someone who has abandonment issues it s a huge gut punch when this happens and I would be happier if they just told me they weren t into me right when they started having doubts which is the mature thing to do  instead of leading me on and me getting attached and invested when in reality  They never did the same thing 
Reddit,What does taking a break do on Facebook dating ,This may seem kind of silly but I have very little experience with online dating  and I recently saw that my boyfriend who used to be on Facebook dating has his account on taking a break  He told me he had  gotten rid  of his account which I don t think is the same as saying ur on a break  I had bumble a couple years ago for a little and from what I remember I could easily take a break and then go back to dating like a switch  Is it the same for Facebook dating or is the process longer  Can he still message people and just not like new accounts  Can his account still be seen by others so if he has something in his bio they can reach him that way  I usually wouldn t consider this a big deal but this isn t a  new  relationship  we ve been together over   months  he told me he loves me  wants to have kids with me  even that he thinks i could be his soul mate  since we re open with our phones im just not sure if it s super easy for him to put taking a break when i come over and then switch it off when i leave  I d appreciate any advice   
Reddit,Is TanTan meant only for Asians looking for other Asians  or can non-asians use it ,Also sorry if this is a stupid question
Reddit,Is this what  winning  feels like ,I use exclusively Hinge now  Used to use Facebook Dating  Tinder  Bumble  etc  at random intervals  but I deleted them all but  Hinge   I tracked my stats for Hinge in       and I had  on average  a      match rate      or so likes a month    -   matches a month    Of those matches  very few ever respond when it s  Their Turn   If they do respond  and it goes well  I usually get their numbers snapchat instagram or whatever  and then it fizzles out   If it doesn t fizzle out  it turns into a date  And for me  a lot of those dates would be at least one or two more dates  and maybe there would be some making out sex intimacy on those dates - but beyond that  it never goes anywhere   I tell my  men  friends my experiences  and they applaud for me getting  anywhere  on dating apps  Even a lot of my attractive women friends tell me it s rare they match with anyone they desire  Both tell me I am  winning  at Hinge  yet it surely does not feel that way  I am tired of the same process of we match -  maybe we talk -  maybe we exchange contacts -  maybe we go on a date s  -  maybe some intimacy happens -  nothing ever happens beyond that   I have had numerous relationships form off of Tinder  for better or worse   but none have ever formed off of Hinge - and that is what I desire    Is there something wrong with me    I have been told numerous times by my dates matches that I am handsome   good in bed  but it surely doesn t feel that way 
Reddit,Are blue collar workers undesirable for college or university educated people ,I ve experienced rejection on dates when I mentioned that I work as a construction worker  Apparently  blue-collar work is seen as being done by poor and dumb people    Yeah  I don t work in the entertainment industry  media  or tech  which seem to be the desired fields nowadays  I m also not a lawyer or doctor  but I actually build tangible things  Things you can touch and feel  not something that only exists online or the like  The company I work for is currently involved in constructing social homes that will stand for hundreds of years  and I take pride in that  However  when I browse online and look at what makes a good profile  I frequently come across the notion that a man should have a university education to have a high-paying job and plenty of free time for traveling and such  What the hell  I think I m quitting online dating for good  
Reddit,I feel like we re overdue for a new major dating app,First it was tinder  then after a few years bumble took over  now hinge is king  It seems like I  and others  are getting fatigued  and yes I do believe that it s because online dating is often soul sucking  But I also think it s because we re used to getting a new major app every few years just to refresh and keep things interesting and we didn t get that  Any thoughts 
Reddit,What to do when you just aren t feeling it,I never know what to do when I m talking to a guy and I m just not feeling it   I know ghosting is not kind but anytime I ve tried telling the guy I m not feeling it he gets super rude and aggressive   What is the nicest way to let him down 
Reddit,I am strictly monogamous from start to finish,And I want the same when dating  I hate the idea of a man going on a date with me one night  and then expressing interest and planning on a second date  but then going on a first date with another girl the next night  To me  that s playing the field and I think it s icky for a multitude of reasons  It s one thing if someone goes on a date with Person A on Tuesday and has a date planned with Person B for the night after  but in my opinion  a decision should be made after the first date as to whom you re going to pursue    This seems to be an extremely unpopular opinion  I am sure a lot of people would respond with  and in a tone of indignance   So you expect exclusivity on the first date   Well  yeah  I do I guess  That s certainly what I offer  and I want the same  So now I am wondering should I just go ahead and say yes to that  if and when that question comes  and just not apologize  I don t think it s unreasonable to want that  To me  when people are proceeding with  nd and  rd and  th dates with more than one person  that to me says the person doesn t know what they want  greedy  insecure and afraid to miss opportunities  doesn t trust that things will work out the way they are supposed to  etc  I can relate to liking two different people at the same time  but I cannot relate to not being able to decide which person you like more or would be better for you  I just don t want to feel like I m on the bachelor  Dating is hard enough but adding competition is just totally whack to me  Everyone wants to feel wanted and to feel special  and you don t make someone feel special or wanted when you ve got other dates lined up  and if you don t tell someone you ve got other dates lined up that is really shady  If I were dating a guy for a couple months and then found out he had been on several dates with another girl at the same time in the beginning I would be out of there in a heartbeat  
Reddit,Is once a scam ,I just downloaded Once and almost every single profile I viewed immediately liked me and sent me a message right after viewing the profile  I m assuming everyone is a bot on this app  It s near impossible that every profile I look at happens to like me moments after I view them and they send me a message as well  I haven t even sent a like out myself yet and half    people in my chats already  Again seems impossible to be legit  Has anyone used this app before and is it a scam  
Reddit,Why does the convo die once you move off the app ,Hi I m not sure if anyone else has the problem but it seems like I ll be having such long  engaging convos with a guy on the app  But as soon as we switch to insta or texting the convo kinda dies and they re just sm less engaged   Has anyone else experienced this  I try to keep the same energy but it seems like they just put less effort in the convo once transitioning
Reddit,  f told me   m that she thinks its best that we keep our distance mutually, I met her online and it was strictly platonic  I started helping her with her homework since I already knew the course content and she mentioned it to me  Long story short  our convo started getting intimate  Admittedly  I did chase her a little and she took wiff of that and started being more reserved  She told me she likes talking to me and said let s just see where it goes    After about three weeks of non stop texting  we ve had some ups and downs and she told me she thinks it s best that we keep our distance mutually  I said ok but I don t get what she means  Prior  she d message me first  ask me about my day  what I was doing  wishing me luck in my meetings at work etc  She sent me pics of her hair to show me how long it s been etc    The thing is  she asked for distance but she s constantly stalking my profile throughout the day  I should also note that she NEVER said she likes me back but she just said let s just see where this goes and she likes talking to me  She answers pretty much anything I ask her except anything romantic like her dating history etc  She never says no to it but she just says she s not comfortable yet telling me  Overall she s very firm and vocal when she expresses her discomfort with questions and I just move on    What does this distance mean and does she like me 
Reddit,How often do you reset your profiles ,Particularly Hinge and Tinder  it s been a month and I ve changed a few pics and my bio but I m not getting any results   
Reddit,My kid is trans  I live in Utah and have no interest in even matching anyone that s isn t trans supportive ,What s the best way to put it in my profile without saying it s my kid  I m wary and protective   It okay if you don t agree with trans  but please DON T comment if it s not nice  I m not here for a debate     Added clarification  I guess what got me further reflecting is I have a very close friend who is completely lgbtq  supportive and has known me for   years and knows all about my trans kid  During a visit last week she brought up how anti trans she was in regards to sports  They should have their own category  She also shared that her son got in trouble in high school that day for saying a joke to his friend  He was reported as making someone else not feel safe in the Utah safety app  She accidentally let it slip that it was a gay joke  Which I completely understand how the other kid might feel unsafe and she just blew it off and told her kid he did nothing wrong  Both things I found upsetting  I just want to avoid the whole scenario in dating and a trying to figure out the best way of weddings weeding it out  Dating in your   s is a big enough shit show as it is 
Reddit,I m scared I m going to die alone, 
Reddit,Is there a dating site for Russians in America ,I m a Russian born F  lived here my whole life but I can see that I would do better with a man with similar culture and values 
Reddit,Dumb question,Sorry  new to dating apps  Is it normal for there to be up to a day between back and forth messages  none of my matches seem to be on at the same time as me to be expected  so messages tend to not get answered until the evening or next morning depending on when they are sent  I typically check the app on my work break or before bed  And get a message the next evening or day   I guess I m just paranoid that I m frustrating the person on the other end because I m not being more attentive  At first glance it seems this is normal because it can t be good for anyone s mental health to be on the app all day  And it seem to be a both sides thing  they take a while to respond to my messages  and I them  But if broadly speaking people expect me to keep notifications on I may need to change some things   Thanks 
Reddit,How far in do you stop going on dates with other people ,How far do you let things go with someone beore you stop going on first dates or other dates with other people  Do you wait until you re official with someone    For context  seeing two women  Both equal amounts of dates in    or so   Going great with both  one slightly better than the other  Seems a bit icky to continue into the   month range with both of them as I m looking for a long term relationship  but don t want to end things too soon  More thinking what if they check my social media in a year and see I ended things with one of them the same week I asked the other to be my girlfriend  I don t know  Seems a bit wrong and getting ahead of myself  Don t want to get rid of one in case the other doesn t work out either

Reddit,Restarting a dead conversation ,I met a guy recently on an app  went on one date and he texted me within an hour of us parting which I thought was a great sign  However  the conversation ran a bit dry within a week  felt like he d stopped trying but was still replying  So I stopped replying  just gave an emoji react   It s been   days and I ve been thinking about him - wondering if or how I should reach out  Since it was actually me who stopped texting  just thought there was nothing to reply to  
Reddit,guy knows my apartment address and asked for his money back after I told him I didn t feel a connection,I made a stupid decision and let this guy pick me up for a first date   i normally drive  but that night there was lots of snow and i was having car issues   we had already facetimed and he seemed really nice and i stupidly decided to give him my apt address      of the time I turn down offers to be picked up  but i had lapse of judgemnt bc of the snow and he seemed really cool    I live in a large apt complex so there are probably    -    apts there and obv doesnt know my apt number  after the date  i told him i didnt feel a connection  and he sent me a paragraph long text message insulting me and abt how i led him on and should pay him back     for the date  he sounded very upset and rude    i dont know what to do and i obv regret giving him my adress  what should i do  im going to be paranoid now whenever im walking around my apt    edit  changed phrasing to clarify that he doesnt know my apt number  but he does the know the address of the complex 
Reddit,Feeling defeated   ,Went on   dates with this guy late last year and we had an amazing connection  for our fourth date I made a reservation to my favorite restaurant  He was saying things to me like  we can be something great together  I m so easy to talk to  etc along those lines  Looking back  on our dates he was putting me on this pedestal  Texting had been sporadic leading up to the date  but I didn t think anything of it since he told me he isn t much of a texter  but he didn t  text me back the day of the date when I asked him if we were still on for that night  He never reached out   Fast forward to today  Was supposed to get drinks with a guy who I ve been talking to for a couple weeks  He initiated getting drinks  however I was out of town  then got covid  We were supposed to get drinks Friday  his idea   but then he said he had plans with a friend  so he wanted to meet today  Then just a couple hours before the date he said his great grandmother had a health emergency  So I firmly  but respectfully told him I didn t want to reschedule or pursue any further   I just get so jaded with online dating  but it s my only way to meet new people    
Reddit,Has anybody made some very nice penpals from dating apps ,I know there s some stigma around being penpals and not meeting up  but I do find it very enjoyable to have penpals that I can text regularly and share about our lives  even if we have not  met yet in real life  Has anybody else had penpals that stuck around for a long time that you still talk to  Would love to hear your experiences and thoughts on this
Reddit,Should i give a specific reason or just a general reason ,Ive been on a few dates with a Woman i met a week or so before Xmas  Interest level from me was moderate  However  im looking for someone thats leans towards been a Homebody Homebodish  It was something we discussed right before meeting or after our first date  To which she said that she is  However  since then ive noticed that she goes to parties and other functions quite often  So whatever interest i had has waned    I tried to slow fade her and didnt text her nor did i hear from her for over a week  Yesterday i got a text from her asking me if i was lost  I replied with no just wasnt sure if this was going anywhere  Today i got another text from her    At this point should i tell her im not interested and give a generic dont feel chemistry or a more informed answer 
Reddit,What s the point,I continuously try to date I get girls numbers on dating apps after I FaceTime them they all ghost me and never hear from them again talk to girls in real life in the street they all reject me and uninterested so I m really asking what s the point to keep trying  Just to keep going through the same thing over and over again 
Reddit,What do you consider  a connection  when it comes to texting,I think we have all gotten to points where you are fed up with having to go back to swiping again  I can definitely think of times when the match fatigue has caused me to ignore some opportunities  This is what makes me keep an open mind when texting on the other end isn t so good  I am curious on how to best deal with people when you don t feel much interest from them  What exactly is a connection when you first match and before meeting for coffee or something    I don t think a lot of women realise how little they do to keep the conversation going  I ve met a few girls who were absolutely awful at messaging and would talk for hours in person    I m curious how other approach the early days of texting someone  At what point do you give up  At what point do you push harder  if someone has matched with you and isn t giving much to spur the conversation  do you let it die 
Reddit,Trying to reschedule a date,So I matched with a guy that I ve met a couple times through work irl  before matching   and we have a date scheduled for today  However  the weather has been awful to the point that most of the local businesses around me are closed  including where we were supposed to meet  I messaged him yesterday to suggest rescheduling and haven t heard back  and again today to tell him that everything is closed so we really do need to reschedule  as well as my number in case that makes it easier to communicate  He would be driving from   min away to meet  and I m worried that he s going to show up anyway  I know I ve done my due diligence  but if anyone can think of anything else I should have or could have done  I m all ears   Update  he did text me  we are finding a new date that works  I do feel better that I did do the absolute best I could in that situation  and relieved that things seem to have worked out  Thank you so much 
Reddit,Friend zoned ,So matched with this girl a bit ago and we talked about seeing each other  I assumed she realized I was meaning a date     We met on a dating app my profile reflected I was looking for a relationship  Our plans fell through a couple of times  Still haven t gotten the  st date     Yesterday I asked her to please clarify what she was looking for and her response was  I know we are friends and such it s ok I didn t know if you wanted to be more never really said    I admit I didn t outright say  let s date  but in my defense it s a dating app we met on   She still hasn t responded to  I would honestly like to get to know you and see about being more no pressure    Kind of at the end of my rope here with OLD  Did I get friendzoned  
Reddit,OkCupid is the scammiest of them all ,I paid for   months of OkCupid  This is what happened         As expected  all my previously hidden likes were from some faraway places like Nigeria  despite my distance preferences      I quickly ran out of local matches  in SF Bay Area no less   and no new matches appeared for months  While on Bumble and FB dating I see new matches appear nearly every day  no such thing on OkCupid - it was a cemetery  and it kept recycling the last few matches over and over  despite me dismissing them      The moment my subscription expired  I get a new  like   which I can t see now  of course   and suddenly all my tabs -  Recommended    Cupid s Picks   etc   come alive  flooding with new people who were apparently in my area all along      Conclusion  OkCupid a massive scam  It s not just your Bumble-level or Tinder-level money-milking  its boldness is only matched by its extreme laziness            would not recommend 
Reddit,Politely asking your dates matches to be upfront  Good idea or big no no ,We ve all been slow-faded or ghosted before  We all hate it  It s usually unexpected and seems to happen more often than not  so picture this   You set up a date  It s a few days out  After you both agree on a time and place  you add in  by the way  if you change your mind or need to reschedule  it s not a big deal  but please let me know ahead of time so I can adjust my plans    Or you ve gone on a date that went really well  You ve both expressed that you d like to see each other again soon  You say  if we end up changing our minds  that s ok  But let s be upfront about it and not ghost each other  Deal    I can see how it may come off as needy  But I feel like if it s said genuinely and without any hidden motive  it can be reassuring and show a strong sense of self and emotional stability   Both times I ve done this  it worked  My ex of   years told me years later that the only reason she didn t flake was because I sent that exact message before our date when I correctly noticed her trying to slow fade out  But two is a small sample size  I d like to hear other people s takes on this 
Reddit,I fear that he won t find as attractive as in my pics,I matched with this guy a while ago  we ve been texting back and forth  Honestly  he seems like a great guy  and probably better than all the previous ones I ve talked to    He is just a typical balanced fun   yo   He s good looking  he parties once a week and he s a DJ  he skates  he jogs regularly  he s very smart  i think he s tall too  but most importantly  he s educated and well mannered  and he didn t mention anything sexual    So  to be honest  when it was time to meet up  I chickened out  I remembered that my previous dates made some negative comments about my appearance  I m   yo btw  They said I looked like a young grandma  others said I don t look like my pics  some never reached out after meeting me   So it left me with the impression that I was not attractive in person  and that I did not look like my pics which is funny because I don t use any filter   So I don t get how different I can be from my pics      Anyways  it hurts my feelings when they stop reaching out  And now with this guy  I fear that he will react the same  Getting called old looking when ure young btw is super unpleasant to hear  so I wish no one to be called that    I don t know what I m doing wrong  Should I put less attractive pics   Show more flaws   Any advice would be appreciated   Or should I cancel the date with that guy and tell him that he may just get disappointed like the others 
Reddit,Good dating apps that are cheap and or free,I am F     and a Lesbian  I ve never actually dated before  and I have a hard time talking to people I don t know  I think starting online would be good since I can talk fine over text or even call  it s just the in person thing that gets me all nervous  So starting online would give me the opportunity to speak with them and get to know them online before meeting them in person    I have already tried Bumble and didn t really like it  Maybe if I paid for the premium features it would work but in the time I used it for free I didn t get a single message  and since I could t see who likes my profile without paying I could never reach out to people myself  outside of the compliments thing   I also found a lot of people there who seemed to be more interested in no serious relationships  which is fine but I m looking for something more serious    The app doesn t have to strictly cater towards LGBTQ  people  but obviously I m not looking for any specifically religious dating apps either  I just need to have the option to match with woman  and or non-binary folks     Thanks    
Reddit,Getting ghosted after asking to meet in location halfway or closer to me,I live in a large city and the people I match with sometimes live in suburbs  When I ask to meet halfway  I ve been ghosted unmatched multiple times   I decided to start asking people to meet closer to me a few weeks ago because there is significantly more to do around where I live and I dislike having to drive long distances only to be flaked on or catfished  I also make it clear to them that I m not asking for a free meal and I offer to get coffee or boba tea  When I mentioned meeting somewhere  close to downtown   I asked   would you mind meeting somewhere close to downtown  to a guy who lives in the suburbs    mi away     min drive    I got unmatched      I was wondering if there was any way I should change my approach to this or if there is any way in which I could phrase things better so I can stop losing matches over this
Reddit,Is there an appropriate way to say  I want to sleep with you but I don t see myself dating you  ,I m in my mid   s and want my next relationship to lead to life long partnership  My dating profile reflects this intent  Having said that  I m picky about long term partners  and OLD is a bit of a numbers game and dumb luck in terms of finding the right person   I ve gone on a lot of first date where I can tell pretty early on that the person is not what I m looking fo long term  but I d still be down to sleep with them  Even if I m looking for long term  sex is fun and think it s stupid to completely deprive yourself of physical connections while you are looking for your ride or die    Is there a tactful way to say -  hey  I know I said I was looking for long term on my profile  but I don t see you as that person  but your cool and I d still like to hook up if you re down  
Reddit,Have you ever reported a match ,I just recently did this on Upward 
Reddit,What phrases are you sick to death of seeing in dating profiles ,I m female  so I m seeing these in men s profiles     again and again and again  I m curious to hear what phrases are overused by women  too    - Just ask  as their entire bio  I can t have any questions for you if you didn t give me anything to be curious about    - Looking for a genuine connection   Yes  that s a given isn t it  Most of us aren t here looking for a disingenuous connection   - I m not here to play games   What games are they taking about   - Looking for someone real   I m never sure what this actually means  and I doubt it would deter  fake  people 
Reddit,Girl I went on a date with was brutally honest almost to the point of self-sabotage,So I met this girl from Bumble a few days ago and we went on a first date the day after we matched  I ve been on plenty of first dates and that one is probably the most unexpected  The girl was brutally honest and told me many things which she clearly knows does not reflect well on her  Some of these things include       She confessed that she cheated in her last serious relationship because she was afraid the guy would cheat and wanted to be the one in power  by cheating first   When I asked her why she thought the guy would cheat  she said it was because her father has cheated on her mom for many times and that influenced her a lot  She did mention though that she s been doing a lot of work on herself in the past   years      She expressed several opinions that she clearly knows are mean wrong  She would often preface her opinion by saying  I have something really mean to say   and when I ask her what it was  she would say things like  all Indians smell like curry  and  I don t date anyone dark-skinned       This is not necessarily something that reflects badly on her  but she has brought up several stories of guys trying to hit on her  date her  etc  From my memory  these stories seem unsolicited and I m not sure why she was constantly bringing them up  Maybe she was insecure and trying to make me chase her    Up till this point she s been interested and wanted to go on another date tomorrow  I ve also made it clear to her that I m looking for something serious  but I think I d ask Reddit  why does it seem like she s sabotaging herself by telling me things about her that are clearly undesirable  Is she just being brutally honest  or am I missing a piece of the puzzle here  I m kind of getting the feeling that she likes to play games so I m treading very lightly here 
Reddit,Asking  matched as friends  on Facebook dating on a coffee date ,Matched as  friends  with a girl on Facebook dating  She s way cooler and has more of the same interests as me than girls I ve actually matched with  not as  friends    I m a big solo hiker   NP goer  and that s like     of her pictures  Would love to do that with her even if it has to be platonic  although she s also gorgeous and I would be interested in more than just friendship     So ladies  what would your reaction be in this circumstance  I have no idea if she s also on the Dating part of the app and just found each other first on friends  or if she has different standards for the two 
Reddit,What would you think,I met this guy online  We ve had   dates within   days  The last   dates were   days in a row   We slept at his house one night  had sex  then my house the last night  Now a couple days later  he asked if I would feel comfortable sneaking into his house after his kids fell asleep and leaving before they woke up  or before the snow storm we expected at  am  I told him no  And then explained one reason would be if the kids woke up and saw me  and two  how it makes me feel like he s just using me for sex  He said sorry and didn t think of that perspective   I asked if he wanted to hangout Sunday evening after he dropped the kids off  He said he has plans with friends to celebrate his birthday  so maybe after that  I can imagine that would be late  like   or   pm  since he drops his kids off around    pm  So another night he just wants to hang out late  See where this is going or am I delulu  Oh  I told him don t worry about Sunday and we can do another night  He said  hope so  but didn t ask about setting up another date  He just wants to have sex  right 
Reddit,Photo tips for a better profile,What kind of photos  minus the handsome looks  would enhance someone s OLD profile for men 
Reddit,Does Leaving Comments Matter When Swiping,I should preface this by saying I do get a decent amount of matches without leaving comments  So I know not every woman requires them before deciding to match with someone  However  I was curious  ladies  if you like a guy s profile  do you still want them to message you with an intriguing comment as opposed to simply  liking  one of your photos  I ve become somewhat jaded with OLD and don t really bother with messages until I actually match with someone  but I m wondering if a witty comment or observation based on a girl s profile would make a difference to them at all    Obviously  a distasteful comment could dissuade someone from wanting to match  but I otherwise don t think it makes much difference 
Reddit,Men  How do you not loose the will to live  What keeps you going ,I    M  decide to give OLD a shot after being single for about   years  I ve been on Hinge  Bumble and Plenty of Fish for about a week    Bumble  I ve had   missed match because she wasn t looking for long term  not had anything since so still I swipe away   Hinge  Not had a single match  sending personalised likes to women that I m interested in is becoming demoralising  I m considering just sending likes without messages  Pof    first contact a day is laughable  so I put in a lot of effort of picking women that has something on their profile and we have something in common  then spend the next    mins or so formulating something genuine and shows I ve put effort in  Had   reply and they haven t been on since  everyone else looks at my profile then never responds   Is my profile the problem  Most likely  am I going to change it  Nope  it shows me exactly as I am IRL and I m not about to pretend to be something I m not   TL DR - guys  what makes you carry on swiping and sending non copy pasta messages  It s only been a week for me and I already feel like calling it quits and going back to my mentally happy place in my own company  Edit  Man some people really take the  loose the will to live  literal like I m about to kill myself  sheesh  it s just an expression of how demotivating it is to endlessly try with little to no result  As it is I ve just gotten back from a night out with a woman in pub with some live music and had an absolute blast  IRL is      way better  to the people with reasonable replies  I wish you the best  the rest of you are clearly single for a good reason  yikes
Reddit,Not into anyone I m    F  going on dates with,Hi   I started going on dating apps sometime in September and have probably gone on   first dates so far  Each one is the same for me  I msg txt them a little bit  they set up the date pretty quickly  I go and make up the same excuse afterwards  i e   realized I m not looking for anything serious    The men dates aren t bad by all means  but I really just want to go home after the first    minutes  I don t really find any of them particularly attractive to the point where I d want to be physical with them  and no one really peaks my interest the way I crushed on people in my younger years  I know I m not actually getting to know them after one date and I m barely texting them beforehand  but I just know that if I don t feel something now I wouldn t feel it later  Idk if I m approaching this the wrong way or not  or if I just am not ready for a relationship  or am looking at the wrong people    Does anyone have a similar experience  How did it change

Reddit,When you unmatch someone and they find your Facebook profile and message you,I m super freaked out  I reported this person immediately but it s crazy how a simple search can turn up all of your personal info  Ladies be careful out there
Reddit,Met an interesting person online but she doesn t want to show her face, So I met her online on a language learning app and we started talking every day  When I started shifting the convo to a more intimate sense  she told me she was kind of confused and wondered why everything went from how s your day and talking about languages to all of a sudden dating    After some more talking  she tells me she likes talking to me and said we ll see where things take us  I asked her if I could see her face  she only shows her hair as her profile pic  and she said not now because she needs to feel comfortable  It also doesn t help that earlier  I mentioned to her how an ugly girl was asking me for a picture of myself and she took note of that and said I sound judgemental    She sounds kind of reserved but we text literally all day long and we send many voice overs  can t be recorded and uploaded it has to be recorded on the spot to be sent to the other user   We ve been talking for about    days now and she still doesn t want to show it and she s claiming I m not patient  What do I do
Reddit,Matches responded faster on apps  but then slower when we moved off the app,Anyone ever experienced this  The matches responded quicker and put in more effort initially when matched on the app  But once you got their number and moved off the app  you noticed their responses started getting slower and even lower quality over time  Almost like a slow fade  Sometimes  they even stop responding altogether  I thought it was weird since most women have their notifications off for the app and are bombarded with matches  that it would make more sense that they d be responding more consistently when moved off the app since there s less  noise  there  Was wondering if this has happened to you and why you think it happens 
Reddit,Badoo is absolute ass,First time feeling ugly since using a dating app in a while lmao  Just a bunch of people I wouldn t go on a date with or scammers   I m deleting that app rn but wow  I thought Plenty of Fat was bad  but Badoo is a tight second  I thought I could over-book in case someone flakes  but so much for wanting to get a bit more volume from using more apps 
Reddit,Women really not interested in casual sex ,I am      extremely good shape  I m told facially cute  I get      matches a day and I ve been on about     dates in the past two years  had sex with    women out of that   However if I m being honest I am mostly interested in casual stuff - not pure hookups but still  My profile either says  short term open to long  or  short term fun    But I swear I ve only encountered TWO women who were actually looking for that  and they didn t seem like it at all base on profile or behavior   I have pretty good  second date retention   like at least      However it almost feels like I m being deceptive despite never overtly lying if when sex does happen  overall just bad vibes after a few times when they realize I m not escalating commitment  I m wondering if this is just the norm in the dating market  kinda makes sense  guys want casual sex more than women so it takes an already skewed gender ratio and skews it even more  or if it s something about my appearance and vibe that suggests boyfriend but not sex partner   I d rather not post my profile  just curious about other peoples experiences 
Reddit,How do i know does he want something ,I     F  recently moved to another country so I got Tinder  Started talking with    M and that s been going on for about a month now  We talk every day  good morning and good night texts  He is showing a lot of interest  asking me about myself  how I am doing  if I miss my family  and things like that  The issue is that he doesn t take any initiative to meet up  so I asked if he was available  We were both off on Monday  so we decided to meet up then  He texted me at around   on Monday that he can t today and that he would love to see me another day but didn t offer any other day or anything like that  We are still talking as normal  but now he is mad because I mentioned that I saw a cute guy across the street  and I really don t know what to think anymore  I told him that I don t really believe that we will meet  and he told me that we will  However  I m scared that I m wasting my time here  even though I really like him  Any advice 
Reddit,Does having a bio even matter ,It seems like most phone based apps are just swipe and it seems like you have to jump through extra hoops to read the bio  So is it even useful to have one  Do people even read them   Based on my experience  some have a good bio but a lot are just saying they re spoofing their location and quite a few that just say  hi  
Reddit,If a woman puts  I want to be  spoiled   in her profile do you assume that she s only in it for the  gifts  ,I do  I assume if she says she wants to be spoiled that means she wants somebody to buy her gifts or take her out for expensive meals etc  It feels very sugar-daddy-adjacent and transactional  like if the gifts stop flowing then she will stop wanting to see me 
Reddit,If someone takes two days to respond to a text message  do you start to lose interest ,I m talking to this woman who is very attractive  To the point that I m concerned that she might be fake  But nothing in the conversation indicates that  The other day we were talking about movies and she said she had watched this movie that had an awkward sex scene  So I asked her if she had watched that movie with her kids  Then it was bedtime so I had to sign off  So I said good night     days later she responds with a message that is kind of like  yeah this is what happened with the movie  and then nothing else   So   - kind of a boring conversation  -  she doesn t seem really interested in learning anything about me  - last month she was sick and I didn t hear from her for   weeks  but this was on the app  not in texting  so it doesn t bother me   - she took several days to respond and didn t really initiate anything in the conversation that I could respond to   I m just wondering if other people start to lose interest in situations like this  I don t think there s enough interest on her end for me to actually ask her out is the problem   Should I just ask her if she doesn t like to text  I have a friend that s like this  she just isn t into texting and will take days to respond unless the message is about planning something  I figure if I ask her about this she s just going to say that she s just busy  And to me just busy is a polite way of saying hey I m not that interested in you 
Reddit,Have you ever used dating apps to specifically make friends and were you successful ,Wondering how many of you have tried making friends through dating apps and was successful  Fwb don t count 
Reddit,How many of you look older than you actually are  Does it effect your results ,We ve heard a lot about baby face being a bit of a hinderance when dating  No one  sane  is trying to tango with a minor so I get it  But I wonder about people who look much older than they are   Lots of men and women lie about their age  Sometimes it s just too obvious  Sometimes they flat out tell you  I m actually     Idk why it said      But I was wondering how many people are hindered by looking older   I got a like on Hinge from a man claiming to be     I m     but he looked like    tbh  I wasn t attracted so it wouldn t have mattered in the end but I guess I m curious if maybe this guy is just aging rather poorly   Had an job a couple years ago where I was an interning student  All of us students got to talking and it came out that another guy there was the same age as me and all of us just looked shocked  unfortunately   He just kinda bleakly nodded and said  Yeah I know   So it s definitely a possibility  I m just curious how often it s a case of  yup  lying about his age to get young women  or  just unfortunate aging  
Reddit,Will she get back to me ,So had a great first date with a girl and ended up home with her  yeah    Trying to set the next date  This weekend she is fully booked but told me she is available next weekend and that she had an awesome time with me   Now I can t next weekend so I told her that I only have Wednesday and Friday available  She told me that she was going to see if she can revise her schedule to meet and would get back to me this evening  Then I responded saying   No rush  Focus on your new job  We will make something happen next week      She hasn t gotten back to me this evening  which is totally fine but now I thought about something else     is my answer maybe me being too available and also would she understand that the ball is still in her court  I know she has a new job so she has a lot going on and therefore didn t want to push so much 
Reddit,How do you feel about a pre-date phone all ,I m a woman and I like to ask men for a phone call before any date  It allows me to check their vibe  get to see if we have chemistry  and it also prevents ghosting on dates I ve never had anyone stand me up after a phone call  knock on wood   However  a    year old man just asked me out  I asked for a phone call and he said he could sense my need to chat was me back pedaling because I wasn t into it and good luck out there  My gut says the guy just wanted to get laid with little effort  Thoughts

Reddit,Wrong Age,I know some people might think I m crazy  but I watch a lot of true crime documentaries   Whenever I match with a person and exchange numbers I have a bad habit of confirming their info on Catfish websites  because you never know   I started talking to his guy and we exchanged numbers and now when I looked him up I see that he lied about his age   He s    and claims to be     I didn t really care until he started showing weird personality traits     He s always whining about something  he s always crying about his ex lol   I could ignore the age thing  but how am I supposed to cope with the whining

Reddit,Unsure where to look or where to find people,I am only    right now  and I know I am not that old but still  I have been constantly trying to find someone  I have never been in a relationship before because of how picky I can be when it comes to that  It s hard for me to find someone that I truly match with because of how I end up seeing relationships  I am not the kind of guy to go  hang out with the bros  but I d rather hang out with my partner instead if she wanted to  This of course means I am looking for someone who would want to play similar video games that I do and be interested in the things I like  The problem is I have been searching for over half a decade and only once I have found someone but she did not feel the same way as she currently did not want a relationship  I have tried plenty of dating apps but most of them require me to spend money or end up not having the people I am looking for on there  Is there any advice on where I should look

Reddit,Confused on how to proceed,I   M never been on a date before with a   F  Two weeks ago I matched with a girl on Hinge who said she was in town for winter break and was basically here for a couple weeks  She actually liked one of my pics first and from there we spoke  I made a bold play and said something akin to  lets bang after the movie  and she said that she s not sure we re interested in doing the same thing on this hangout  I apologized and told her I assumed some things because she s on vacation  Told her id still be down to hangout tomorrow because itd be nice to hangout with someone over break and id be less nervous with that off my chest  She agreed and we had a good time cuddled a bit  even texted me when she got home to tell me she had a great time  After Christmas we met up again everyday at a cafe while we worked  chatted  and played games  basically the whole day together  with more physical contact and even me touching her thighs while driving   another movie she wanted to see while cuddling even more holding hands  To be honest I d like to escalate contact because I d like to finally lose my v-card but ive basically asked her if it was ok to do all the physical stuff I mentioned before because Im actually terrified of making her either uncomfortable or like she can t get out of a situation  She ll be leaving soon before break for her ends too    If escalating isnt something she wants she s obviously within her rights to decide what she s comfortable doing and not doing  But my question is should I continue to make moves like I have or how can I communicate that Id like to do more    Im worried about pushing too hard and catching a case or just fumbling

Reddit, Confidence is attractive ,I hear that being said when asking friends and family about dating  You know what else is attractive     Being attractive  In fact  unless im wrong  I m pretty sure being physically attractive is more appealing than being confident  You can be confident and unattractive and still be turned down   This btw applies for both women and men in dating
Reddit,How soon should I be asked on a date ,I m new to the online dating scene and I m just wondering when men typically ask women out or what s considered  normal   I m not the type to go back and forth texting for too long  I d much rather go on a date right away  Most of the men I ve matched with either take too long to respond  a few days  or they take weeks to respond and immediately ask me out  which seems kind of odd  but not sure if that s normal    What are the red flags I need to look out for  I m looking for a man who s serious and it seems like no one on the apps are  I m trying to remain optimistic but online dating already rubbed me the wrong way to begin with   Any pointers would help 
Reddit,Not seen due to location ,I live in rural area in Sweden  and the nearest town is about half an hour s drive away  I used to live in another part of the country for work near a large city and I actually noticed far more likes and OLD activity back then  Driving is not problem for me  it is a part of life on the countryside  but I feel that my location affects my profile visibility a lot  I have pretty wide radius but I am wondering if people I like actually see my profile   I won t move again  but I am wondering if there is any way to compensate for this  or just deal with it 
Reddit,Should i just let this slow fade ,I met someone right before Xmas  We had   short dates  She works for a Hair Salon and the Holidays are extra busy so she was usually really tired  Although we did go to her house for one of them after we were suppose to got to a bar  However  she changed her mind  So we had a legit date that time  I also dropped her off at a NYE that was nearby and that was last time i saw her albeit briefly   Im not quite feeling any sparks  She will answer if i text however recently she stopped initiating  So im thinking it could be the same for her  We havent communicated since Thurs night and that was brief 
Reddit,Opinions on slow texting,I am using Hinge and I got a like from a woman with no message  just a plain like on a photo  I had actually skipped her profile earlier when I was browsing since I didn t find her attractive or anything interesting on her profile to comment on   I matched with her regardless and then she started a conversation  We exchanged maybe    messages over   days in total and then she asked me out to grab a beer  We met and she was such a lovely person  I liked her and said that I would like to meet her again to get to know her more and she said that would be cool  But I was going to travel after   days for     weeks   Now I am away and I wanted to keep things going by texting  Problem is that she is either terrible at texting or she is just not interested anymore  She usually texts back after   -   hours and we are on the same time zone  The thing is  she asks follow-up questions in her replies  so they are not half-assed answers   It s impossible to know what s up  maybe this is just how she is  but from women s perspective  would that be considered as a dying interaction  I don t want to bother her by texting a lot  but at the same time I want to keep things rolling while I am away 
Reddit,Smokes Occasionally socially,If you are someone who has marked your profile as  smokes occasionally socially  can you tell me what you mean by that

Reddit,Should I give up ,- I m   f and have been single for   and a half years  During that time I have been dating for around two years  Getting over my ex and the pandemic meant I wasn t ready until then   - I started logging my dates about   months ago and since then I have dated    guys  I have met these guys on apps  One guy has approached me in real life  part of the same hobby  but he is    so it s a no no from me  Majority are just one or two dates    have been between   and   month things  I have no trouble attracting guys or getting matches  I have almost always been the one to end things  Either there just isn t a connection I don t fancy them or sometimes they lied on their profile  A couple of instances of bad behaviour have happened with the longer term ones  example carrying on with sex when he knew the condom broke without checking    - Almost everyone I know is in a serious relationship and I m starting to feel defective  I really want to share my life with someone and find my person  It s very lonely   - I am independent  have my own place  a good job  live in a major city  am a nice person  Im attractive  look young for my age and I am in good shape   - Im looking for a guy on my level  independant and has his shit together  Sense of humour and being considerate and calm are really important personality traits to me  I am more flexible on looks as long as the person takes care of themselves   - I m getting to the point of thinking I should give up  Are my standards too high  I don t want to date down  I really enjoy my life and the worst part of being single honestly is the judgment from others  I want someone to add to my life and happiness  I just can t find that person   - Can anyone offer any insight or advice 
Reddit,I have   matches on hinge and none have replied for days  is my app glitched ,Years ago I was previously shadowbanned from Hinge  not sure why  I have remade a new account using a new phone  photos etc  I now have   matches and for about   of my matches I had good convos with but then suddenly I stopped getting any messages from them  Not sure if they re ghosting me or the app is broken  It seems unlikely that all   matches will ghost me for days  if they weren t slightly interested they would not have matched with me   I tried logging out of hinge and back in and nothing happened  When I click on the messages tab after logging out and back in the message counter shows I have   match messages but then it goes back to    not sure if that s a glitch or hinge are not showing me my matches   Anyone else experienced this

Reddit,Decoding this weird Instagram post after being dumped ,Hi everyone  me and this guy met online and really hit it off  At one point we talked about our future goals  and I brought up wanting to buy a house someday  He freaked out  and I guess was  triggered   lol    So he broke up with me  and then posted this on Instagram the next day   Overall  I m hurt and confused  and none of my friends know what to make of this   haha    Picture  https   imgur com a    BfEA 
Reddit,I m so frustrated about guys lying about their height,It honestly just waste my time when I go out  drive all the way and meet them whenever this happens  If a guy is     and he said so on the app  and he has a great personality and looks cute I ll still meet up and I know what to expect  If a guy is     and puts       combined with pictures that are taken in weird angles he basically shows up as a completely different person as what I expect  And my brain just disconnect this person from whoever I was chatting with on the app  I am too nice to walk out on someone so I try to carry the conversation for an hour or so but I can t feel any attraction if this is the case  Lying is so off putting to me  And then at the end of the day I have to draft a nice message to turn the person down nicely without directly mentioning the height thing    There are reason some people care about height  it s shallow  but we are on a dating app to date not to find friends  Attraction matters and physical attraction is a big part of it  Guys if you re lying about your height please stop   Edit  posted this mostly as a venting post  did not expect to garner this much attention and agonize so many men and women against each other  Bottom line is do not lie or misrepresent yourself on dating profiles no matter what gender you are  if you want to be liked for who you really are
Reddit,Women wanting children after    ,  m with two high school age kids here   I come across women who say in their dating profiles that they want to have children and start a family when they are well into their    s and a surprising   are in their late    s and early    s   Is this becoming more common in our society or is there something in the water cooler   Risks increase with age as we all know  I support this decision if that is what they want but usually swipe left because I m not a good fit and I also do not want to get in the way of anyone s dreams  I m not Hugh Hefner or Al Pacino either   Many women say this when they already have children too - they state they want to have more   Sometimes it s the dating profiles limited choices so I often thought that this was a mistake and meant that they are fine with the man already having kids yet I see this quite often  I wanted to ask for other people s perspective on this - especially women   Yes  I ll always ask them directly but I can t do this if I m swiping left and never matching   Please no haters here as it s a legitimate question and I respect people s opinions and their right to choose   have them   My theories include but are not limited to careers  creating a profile may trigger maternal instincts and or increased libido  may think it s appealing to men  they may want to create something more lasting and permanent  prefer unprotected sex  find the idea romantic  have a void in their life  want the chance for another boy or girl  the potential for more financial support should a potential marriage fail  or they simply love cream pies made with a banana   TL DR   Why does there appear to be a growing   sizable number of women wanting to have children much later in life 
Reddit,What to ask my date in person ,Sorry for the general question  but basically I m in this situation where I matched with a woman and I haven t gotten to the part of asking her what her interests are because I want to ask those questions when I meet her in person  But if I ask them through text and all the questions I ve thought are answered through there  what do I ask her in person   UPDATE  She ended up turning me down cause I didn t have a set goal  Honestly I thought everything checked out with what she was looking for but not that  Anyways  thanks for all the input and advices  Hope y all have a good new year  
Reddit,Why would a someone text first and then not respond ,I ve had matches in online dating in the past where they would try to start a conversation with me out of nowhere but then after I reply    they just disappear  Then they might try to reappear later just to try the same thing  These may people who you ve been chatting to for a while too or even have their number  Anyone experienced this before

Reddit,Are most men waiting for women to ask them first for the date  Or just indifferent ,So I ve been back to dating now for   months  post divorce   I was married for quite a long time  I m   F   and the game has definitely changed   Let s just say it s been a steep learning curve along the way    During that   months I ve had a few men be very upfront about asking me on a date  and repeat dates  straight out   Very direct and to the point   However  I ve noticed a much larger majority seem to sort of dance around the topic  expressing interest but not asking and I will then have to drive the point home and be direct about asking them after a certain amount of time   I mean  there is only so much messaging before you just get to the point or move on   I d say   times out of    when I ask  they respond very quickly and are immediately all about picking a day time and then following through promptly    Maybe one time out of    they seem to slow roll a response  but then come back and start setting it up  I assume they were considering other options and juggling me in that schedule    And then maybe one time out of    they seem to either slow roll indefinitely  or just side step it   At which point I assume they are considering other options and I m not really a serious consideration for them  at which point  i just move on    I have other options  no need to worry about this one     So is this just the nature of men consider many other options that they won t ask first   Are they just indifferent to me specifically  but if I show interest then they just jump on the opportunity   note  I m always clear that first date isn t going to be a hook up  no shade on those that like that   it just isn t for me    Or is this more that they are just avoiding rejection as they assume the woman has lots of options and they are waiting for her to very clearly confirm interest   I find it so baffling    and honestly would just like to be asked more often vs having to do the asking    Thoughts 
Reddit,Why would someone who matched before would want to match again ,A girl on an app I talked to disappeared after I asked her out but now she s liked me again  A bot I m guessing 
Reddit,Girl asked me to get tested and for her to see the results before we do anything,I matched with this girl online in the evening  we started talking and as the evening went on she started to take things more flirty and sent teasing pictures through Snapchat  I matched the energy with her to flirt back and also tease  after a few messages she then says that she wants me to go get tested and for me to show her the results before we do anything together in person  tested as in STD btw   I have not had much luck with females in my life  I have actually only slept with one female  in which it has been almost   years since my last sexual activity  The few girls I have had any success with never asked me to get tested so I am unsure how to approach this  I know for myself I am clean but just as unsure how anyone else would approach this situation   Edit  Just to update everyone who reads this now as of       the girl never replied to me when I asked her to show me the results so on to the next  Appreciate the replies

Reddit,When guys don t answer questions,I feel like most women have experienced talking to guys and not being asked any questions about themselves  But what do I make of a man who asks me questions but ether glosses over mine or doesnt answer them at all   I feel like its such a small thing  but I couldn t help but notice he doesnt really answer my questions back   
Reddit,Guy messages back after       weeks ,  m texts me  f  back ages later with actually engaging questions and response to previous post  I don t like to ghost others but this seems warranted  Although part of me wants to ask him what he s thinking or what happened  We hadn t texted back and forth that much so I had figured he wasn t interested and let it go  I mean he owes me nothing but if he wants a reply shouldn t he have given an explanation for the gap  Even if it was  sorry I didn t reply because I was dating someone that didn t work out  wanna start over   But maybe I m overthinking Thoughts 
Reddit,First question - how long have you been on this OLD site ,What do you think of being asked   how long have you been on this dating site     I ve been on a long time   Not proud of that     Why would that be the thing of most interest to someone  of all the questions that could be asked   It s the least interesting thing about me

Reddit,What would you do if the guy tells you he lied about his age ,Happened to me recently  First date  outta nowhere  he told me he is     not    like his profile says  I was too stunned to say anything  I acted like it was fine  but felt weird about it when I got home  I didn t even ask him why he lied on the profile  This is Hinge which I don t believe is linked to your FB  What would you have done if you were in my shoes  realistically   I mean on the date  would you end the date immediately or be polite and finish the date

Reddit,Sould I be suspicious if a question is conspicuously not answered ,Every now and then  I ll come across a profile that seems mostly complete  but one or two traits won t be listed    For example  most apps ask of you re a drinker  with some variation of Yes  No  and Sometimes as options  but sometimes I ll notice that there s no answer on someone s profile  even though the smoking and weed answers are there  Should I assume it s just an oversight  or that they re hiding something   This also applies to relationship goals  politics  and even whether they have or want kids  Which just seems weird because there s usually a  not sure  option for all three   This mostly applies to hinge  but I ve seen it on a couple apps specifically looking for a LTR  And I m a guy looking a women s profiles  if that s relevant

Reddit,I am probably the unluckiest one    F  Rant,Hi there   As an Asian woman trying OLD for     years    F   I can conclude that I have probably the worst luck  People are shocked when they hear I am single  as I am financially independent  have my own house  moderately attractive and easy-going  I clearly put  serious relationship and no hook ups  on my profile  Here are my stories    - met a Vietnamese guy  Tinder  trying to touch my butt on the first date  I run away and he chased after me for   blocks and stopped after I ran into my building     - a Chinese guy  OKCupid  who I have dated for a year and hid the fact that he has severe heart condition and probably won t live very long  His dad passed away from heart attack and his mother had to live in hospital in Japan  He wanted me to move to Japan to sacrifice my life to take care of his mother  I can t do that  so we broke up  He never mentioned any of these in the whole year    - another Chinese guy  Tinder and long distance  who is married  He has different identities across different apps  I dated him for   months until his wife massaged me on fb  Traumatized      - a Chinese guy  TanTan  who stalked me after I turned down his sex request on second date  Sent me lots of horrible messages and finally stopped when I told him I will call the cops on him    - a Canadian guy Plenty of Fish  who I got alone with well  We are actually school mates  so I can get tp know him better before commitment  We dated for   years  He proposed me after   years but canceled it due to his career change that required him moving to US and   leaving me behind  He had no choice as he was a broke student and desperately needed money     -  the worst  a Singaporean guy  Tinder  who has untreated bipolar and BPD  Dated for   months  I was love-bombed and manipulated big time  He went physical on me over something trivial  Later I found out from the police that he has a history of domestic abuse back in his country  The result is a   year restraining order and   therapies for PTSD   I guess I am cursed    I guess part of the reasons of my horrible OLD history is that I didn t really know these people  I mean  how do we really know  It s OLD  They can hide things so well   After    years of turbulent experiences on OLD  I now decide to move to a new city  and try to get to know people IRL  I will not take the risks anymore  because meeting the wrong people can potentially ruin your life 
Reddit,He DMed me first and then left me on seen ,So me and this guy have been following eachother for a minute  and then I guess he unfollowed me  He followed me again yesterday and then liked all my pics  I didn t say anything  and then he messaged me today and said idk how I know you  but I wanted to say hi  So I replied and said thanks for breaking the ice  I don t remember as well but nice to meet you and how s it going   And then just straight seen  He s actually quite cute and we work in the same field and in the same region  He s been watching my stories but no reply  Do I just wait it out  Or can I say something more    Thanks

Reddit,Girl says she may be free for a third date,So    M  I ve been on two dates wirh this girl    F  whom I met on Hinge  The two dates with were great and we kissed on the second date  I should note that I m the first person she met off Hinge  However  earlier today I asked her what her schedule looks like after this Christmas  She replied by saying that she might be free on the   th but not sure  and that if she s not free  it ll have to be in January  I then asked her what potential plan she may have on the   th  and she said that she  may  get dinner with friends    I m all too familiar with this wishy-washy attitude from girls  but how should be proceed from there  I m thinking I can either give her the benefit of the doubt and appear nonchalant by saying  cool  just keep me updated   Or  I can communucate more directly  asking her to clarify if this is a mixed signal and something to put me on the back burner  or if she s still interested   What do you guys think 
Reddit,Do you ever feel guilty when multidating ,I know this topic is a little redundant because usually the answer is that until exclusivity is discussed  then it s free game  But for some perspective  there are   women I m seeing atm  Had my  nd date with one on Tuesday and my  rd date with another last week  Texted the one from Tuesday today but haven t spoken with the other one I had the  rd date since Monday  Prolly gonna text her today    That said with Christmas being in a few days  family coming in town  and talking to other matches  and burnout  I m a bit overwhelmed  And I don t know how to explain it because even though things are going well with the girl I had   dates with  I m not sure how I feel yet even though I m open to seeing her again  And for the record  I haven t slept with any of them  The most Ive done is kissed    I think this where the paradox of choice illusion of choice comes in with online dating  I think multidating is a double edged sword because trying to find that balance between not putting your eggs in one basket and also not stretching yourself out too thin as it gets so overwhelming and of course expensive  And I think the  guilty  feeling comes in where you could be seeing someone and it goes well but since you re not committed  you can match with someone you find more attractive and may have more in common with leading you to be fickle    Can anyone else relate 
Reddit,Best App for Meeting New People - UK ,   M UK  straight  Single  and unexpectedly alone over the whole Xmas new year period   Thinking it might be nice to use the time to try meet some new people and to get  out and about  a bit  Not really thinking long term at the moment  want to just see what happens   What s the best app for this sort of thing  Tinder  Bumble  Hinge  etc   It s been about ten years since I ve done any online dating  and these things change all the time  so I m not sure how the land lies these days   Thank you 
Reddit,Is this a little extreme ,So I matched with this guy  had one good conversation over messages for a couple of hours  we both agreed we re happy to keep it casual or just make friends  Made plans to meet up this weekend  he was definitely showing more interest than I was  but I definitely showed interest too  Then the conversation suddenly stops  He doesn t reply  Then I get an Instagram friend request from him  which he deletes within    minutes of requesting  And then the next day requests again and this time I accepted  And I saw that he s viewed my stories etc and all of a sudden BLOCKS me on Instagram entirely  What    This is just ridiculously funny to me but also yes a bruise to my ego  If you didn t like something about me you could ve just said it  what an intense reaction  Definitely feel rejected but wow that was probably the craziest reaction I ve had so far from someone   EDIT TO ADD  HE UNBLOCKED ME AND TRIED TO ADD ME AGAIN

Reddit,What are your biggest pet peeves in online dating ,There are three in particular that come to mind for me  I will rank them from annoying to most egregious      A profile with only group photos  What is the point of putting yourself out there when I see your friends more than I see you      Taking the time to match with someone but not interact with them at all  I know some people only use dating apps as a game  but it is done at the expense of other people      People lack the ability to communicate  I wish more folks understanding that dating is not always about yourself  Oftentimes  when people talk  it is about what they want  They rarely asked about the wants of their partner

Reddit,Guy approached me and stopped responding after I sent a picture ,This Redditor approached me on my other account claiming that he liked my posts and asked me if I were single  He lives about     miles away from me  He said if he felt we were a good match  he wouldn t mind visiting me or pay for my flight   I didn t trust him  He is early   s  acted too excited with me and he even offered to buy me things within days  He bought me a videogame off Steam  Then he asked me if I would like for him to send me some Uber Eats  I politely refused   We have been talking and is smart and respectful  But he seemed to be rushing things like we are ideal and we could have a family together  I just don t think someone that age range would act so  Quite weird  We were teasing some sexual comments to each other but that s it  I sent him a partial picture where I was wearing a provocative dress and he just disappeared  Not sure if he has been lying and has a wife  And also I don t understand why people put so much effort just to ghost

Reddit,Ghosted after   months of dating  so exhausting,We met on a dating app and I thought he was special  after   months of seeing each other  he planned to go to Cancun and I took the opportunity to I asked him to give it a thought about us being exclusive during his trip  after that day he went very silent   he used to text me everyday    not sure if he is back or not  I haven t received any text from him  but I don t want to text him either since he was very cold in our last interaction  I refrain myself from texting him and find out if he is just ignoring me or if he is still on his trip  even if he was still in Cancun he could ve found other ways to communicate with me  it has been almost a month since we saw each other   It is so mean of him not to say anything at all and just disappear like that  I just wanted to ask  if you were seeing someone for   months do you think is valid to ghost them without a word since you weren t officially dating

Reddit,Question for the ladies,I have a question about conversation flows  I m curious if this is a universal thing or if I may be overreacting  I get a fair amount of mutual matches and when I reach out they will respond  But a lot of the time it feels like I m talking to a brick wall  I ask them a question and get one word responses  It get super frustrating trying to hold a conversation because their isn t any back and forth  When I ask if they are not interested as it seems like they aren t really wanting to talk they tell me they are and want to keep messaging  Is this something that is common and I should try a different way of talking  or are they really not interested and just being polite  I am genuinely confused as to what is happening and am wondering if I am overreading the issue or if I need to change the way I message them 
Reddit,Asking About A Date Again,I    F  had been messaging a guy for a few days on Bumble and asked if he wanted to schedule a date on Friday  I didn t hear back from him  so I figured he wasn t interested  which was a little disappointing since our conversations were good  I usually wait    hours to unmatch since weird things happen  and I was right this time   He had a medical emergency and was in the hospital overnight   He s home recovering  but he s messaging me still  and even messaged first yesterday     When should I broach the subject about meeting again 
Reddit,Its Christmas   Arent there any happy  ending  stories to tell ,I mean theres likely to be a negative bias - ie people come here to complain or when somethings gone wrong    but its xmas guys and girls    it sure would be nice to hear a positive story   now there are two simple rules for your submission      must be recent- Ie you first started talking to this person OLD within the last    months or so  Why cos OLd seems to have degraded substantially post covid    so this is the most relevant frame of reference for those still looking    the person you matched with is someone youre genuinely happy to be with and youre in a longer term relatationship    mongomous etc   IE this isnt for you to call out your booty call prowess   give us singletons some hope please   also do share if theres something you did different to what you normally do  different pictures or profile narrative or maybe just the people youd usually go for       x   B     x   B

Reddit,We agreed to have sex but he keeps saying he s busy,Hey guys  I need some serious advice here    So I  F    matched with a guy on tinder and we both agreed we re just looking for casual sex  We texted  a lot of flirting   compliments on both ends and sexted a bit  We both said that we re really busy due to work and just looking for something casual    Problem is  we re trying to find a time to meet and he always says he s busy  I m not sure if I ve done something wrong  but I m just getting the vibe that he s not interested anymore  He s stopped trying to initiate and only responds when I text  I haven t texted him for a week now and we haven t spoken since    So I guess I m just asking if anyone s got advice  This sort of thing happens to me a lot  I have no problem getting guys to match with me on tinder saying they want something casual  but just can t get anyone to actually follow through in real life    The guys I match with usually say that they ve not had a lot of success   matches  They usually give me a lot of compliments and talk about wanting to have sex  goes both ways   but then back off as soon as I try to meet in person    Also wondering if any girls have experienced this too   any guys done this to anyone before 
Reddit,Guy says  no romantic connection ,Can someone explain this to me from a guys perspective   all posts I see are of girls saying this generally when they aren t physically attracted   I met this guy a while back and went on   dates before it faded  should ve been my clue i guess  but he was suffering from depression so I let him be  He came back and we hung out again  I confronted him about the fade and he said he thought I wanted something casual and that I didn t give off romantic vibes  that should have been clue    but I assumed it was a miscommunication on my end which I cleared  Last   times I slept over   but I insisted on not having sex although he wanted to  He was understanding  And we sexted a bunch  So I m guessing he was physically attracted  Anywho cut to yesterday he says he thinks I want something serious and he doesn t feel a romantic connection and is open to be friends   This whole time he s texted me frequently   opened up about depression which I was helping with  we ve made out a bunch  talked about family and finances  he mentioned things in future tense  we should start doing blah-blah together    hell we both even cried at a point discussing certain things  he asked me about my past relationships  A part of me initially thought as he got to know me he realized my personality didn t seem compatible enough for him  But going over the events in my head  he had deemed it  no romantic connection  at the very start on our first date where we hardly spent an hour together  And if that was the case  why come back  just be gone  I m heartbroken once again  but it seems my fault honestly for giving him the chance 
Reddit,Am I overthinking this ,I found this guy on Hinge  I liked him because he was cute and all  He kept on insisting on getting my number despite me trying to give a royal ignore to that ask  so I caved in  He instantly messaged me on WhatsApp and started to say I am cute etc  etc  He also insisted on having a call  Which I didn t mind but I am not a conversationalist and tried to get out of that call as soon as the call timer hit    mins  He did all the talking and I didn t mind  The call lasted for   hours and I had to act like I am sleepy to get out of it  He eventually  on that same call  started to make futuristic plans - I can add you to this XYZ plan  we could go on this trip  I want to take you to that hotel etc  He even dropped the marriage bomb because I said I have a sweet tooth and apparently so does he    Exact words were - Oh I am going to marry you    I am passing it off as a joke but he kept on insisting that I will become his girlfriend    On the call  he also kept boasting about his job which is with an airline so he gets the reserved seats  He also talked about his exs for some reason  I know all of them now   On the call he insisted on me sending him more photos of mine because he wants to look at my face  I mean I am just like aren t the   on Hinge enough for you  I will not lie I did end up sending one and then he started to complement the shit out  It was  the photo  from a recent wedding I had attended and I honestly had not received that many compliments from anyone at the wedding compared to what he gave me  He started to micro-analyze my make-up too    At the end of the call I felt really drained and instead of meeting him during the coming weekend  I was of the opinion that maybe I should get done with this on a Monday  The day after this   hour call  sunday  he called again and I cut the call telling him we should save the convo for Monday but he still sent photos from his day  which I guess is fine    So  we met on Monday  Again at the date he kept on talking about his exs  work and as usual did all the talking  I don t think I was asked any question during this round however  at the end of the date he kept on telling me how he likes my aesthetic the way my hair is curling and the sweater I am wearing is giving so many different textures  He also talked about making plans for Chirstmas and New Years and I was like I am out of town but he was like we can still do something in the middle of the week and make it feel like festive and all  And when I came back home then also the compliments continued    Now the flags I am seeing are the constant compliments  even my friends don t do that maybe I have odd friends I don t know but no one has ever complimented me so much and I was thinking maybe this is love bombing to some extent    The other thing that ticked me off was that he often left blanks in a conversation for me to fill-up  The kind where you behave like you know something but you don t actually  The one that I remember distinctly is on the photo he commented -  oh yeah I know what you re wearing  Its a    a    a     only for me to complete that its a lehnga  He also wants to make a wild guess about my whereabouts  Like for Sunday  even though I cut his calls and didn t react a lot to his messages he made the wildest assumption that I was out shopping with my mom  The topic of shopping or that I spend one of the days on the weekend with her have arose     The constant futuristic plans do scare me as I have been single all my life and had made it very clear on the night of the call that no more talking like that but it continued to some extent  The exs talk is also something that were unsettling for me    I also have this gut-feeling since the date that there is something wrong but I can t pin-point on it  So  am I overthinking this or should I actually slowly break it off    Edit - another thing I remembered is he found my Instagram and while on the date when we were talking about something i was unable to get internet and told him that he can look through an x particular story highlight to get a reference  He said he thinks he already knows what I m talking about because he went through my profile in search of my face 
Reddit,Are some online dating sites better than others ,What is the best OLD site out there  And are there other sites I should just avoid 
Reddit,Why is Hinge trolling me ,Hinge subred moderators must work for Hinge because they deleted this post off of the Hinge sub Reddit  Which is ridiculous    I am being      truthful and I m asking a sincere question  I am looking for a real relationship  and they re showing me nothing but what seems like a I profiles  So I m going to post here in case this happen to anyone else who can relate  empathize  or shed light   So didn t log on for a while  Maybe a couple of weeks  I log on to find the first like    profiles to be Women that look like they walked off the cover of some kind of vogue or other fashion magazine  Not like anyone I ve ever met in real life  Not like anyone I would ever consider dating because not my type  nor would I be there type so it would never happen   It wasn t just one photo  They re all like in bikinis  with not a blemish  wearing these very revealing outfits and honestly  these are not real people  If they are  I don t know a single person like this   So I decide to quickly ex-wife through them hoping to get somebody real because I m looking for  real   not photo shopped model front cover magazine person    No I just started laughing  I wish I someone who called themselves a mob boss by profession and is wearing a leather revealing Areas of a woman s body I didn t know existed  lol  Next to the occupation profession they wrote mob boss  Next   The next profile the woman says her occupation is a secret and in one of the problems says that the Russian government is looking to arrest her and that she s being serious  Un  ok      Next   This goes on and on and it got to the point of such ridiculousness that I just started laughing out loud literally   Why is Hinge doing this to me   They have them listed as my most compatible and I dare say I am not at all compatible in any way shape or form with any of these women  Not even in my wildest fantasies       I don t even believe they exist but even if these were real people  they re not people I would be into nor would they be into me   Not by a long shot  How do I get real people   When I first joined I got women that were literally over     pounds  covered in tattoos  piercings All over their bodies  with different color hair and while this may appeal to some men  they couldn t be further from what I was seeking  It took several months before I was actually shown real women that I could see dating  Then I stopped for a while  And now the complete opposite     has this ever happened to anyone else and what the heck is going on     Does the Hinge Algorithm really think I believe these are real people that are datable   PS  I just went back to Hinge to check out the next profile  Guess what  now I got a dominatrix   Seriously Hinge  I want to meet a real woman and have a real relationship  Give me a break  And for context before someone suggests there might be something in my profile that is eliciting this  it is very conservative  I have normal hobbies like playing racket sports and enjoy dancing at weddings  There s not one picture that is suggestive nor one word in my profile suggesting that I want some kind of alternative lifestyle partner  It s honestly bizarre  And these women are incredible good looking  But unrealistically so   Just not real  I think AI hacked my Hinge account and put these profiles  That is the only logical explanation to me 
Reddit,Have you ever felt rushed in online dating ,In my recent experiences with online dating  I couldn t help but feel like I was being rushed  I m a person that moves slowly when new people come into my life  I don t like to jump into things headfirst because I have no idea how long someone will be in my life  I don t like to get too invested too early  As a result  I ve found that my personality may not suit online dating    The women that I ve crossed paths with have been fine  but it s just the pace that throws me off  I don t like to go on first dates with the pressure of knowing that the other person is looking for expecting a long-term relationship to come about  For me  that makes things uncomfortable and I feel like I have to walk on eggshells because I don t want to rule out that possibility  but I also don t want to softly commit to anything on date number one because it s still very early and you don t really know anyone after only a few weeks of talking  I think this leads to a lot of women that I come across getting dissatisfied because I m not going into dates thinking   surely this is the person I m going to be with long-term   nor am I behaving that way  I like to go into dates thinking   let s have a good time and see how we feel   I don t know within   -   days of knowing someone if I want to be in a relationship with them long-term  Give me    to    days to get to know them  and then I can know more surely    I think this is likely a common occurrence for both men and women alike  There s this weird expectation that every date has to hit the nail on the head and be the person that can make you get off of the apps  otherwise it s a waste of time and they need to be dispatched and never heard from again  It s a very strange phenomenon to be a part of  and I believe you can feel when you re in it    Have you ever felt this 
Reddit,Older men do not pursue younger women because they are  easier to manipulate  they are considerably more attractive,I am tired of this myth being pedaled  generally by older  undesirable women past their prime  The idea that these men are targeting these women because they are naive and impressionable is obviously utter nonsense  it is      because   -   year old women are far more physically attractive  period

Reddit,What are people who put monogamy as their relationship type want from OLD ,I    f  have been on a few dates with a guy who has his relationship type visible as  monogamy  in his profile but has nothing on it about what he s looking for  I ve seen profiles like this a lot and I m just wondering  are people that are truly monogamous mostly looking for something long term  I kind of feel like if you re looking for something casual short term that s not really monogamy  Sure you might be seeing one person at once but if you re switching between people every few weeks that doesn t feel like monogamy  I m just curious  Should I assume that this guy I ve been seeing would be open to a relationship if we continue to see each other  I do plan on asking him after a bit but it feels a bit early and don t want to scare him 
Reddit,How does anyone keep their sanity   selfworth using dating apps ,  M and I think I need to call it quits on OLD  It all just feels like such a massive waste of time and just leaves me feeling so undesirable and deflated    On the off-chance you do actually get a match  there is zero reciprocity  I tried so many times to initiate a conversation  ask something interesting about their profile or goals  And not even getting one question back  Tried to make jokes  the slow   fast approach  On Tinder it seems     of the likes you get are from bot   scam accounts   Bumble isn t any better  I thought the whole selling point is that women need to initiate so maybe there will be some effort on display  Nope  Zero effort  no questions about anything on my profile  Or any attempt to get to know me   Ok so OKcupid  Nah  the only matches I get are from Kenya or the Phillipines  I m from Europe  and I have my account set-up so it should only show people from my area    I think in total I got like    matches in roughly   years of using the apps  Which led to a whopping   dates in total    Seriously  how does anyone not lose their minds on dating apps 
Reddit, Must be a good listener ,Every time I see this on a profile  I feel like I want to reply with    Must talk about interesting things   Am I the only one

Reddit,Any Apps that Choose your Photos for you ,So I always tend to second guess or overthink what I should use for my pictures and then run into the issue of constantly switching them non stop   Does anyone know of an app or something that goes through an album of photo and then picks the most optimal ones   Automatically using code or ai or whatever   Not the ones that use other people rating or ones you have to rank yourself    Or does anyone know a free source where I can just get my photos looked at and picked
Reddit,Should i keep my instagram public to help in OLD ,   M looking to date intentionally    I wonder if keeping my insta public would help with my OLD efforts  Say a woman who matches with me and wants to check if i have any red flags etc can scan my insta to validate that i have got my shit together and have some friends hobbies etc    Can ppl please advise 
Reddit,Is anyone actually dating ,   f  single mom in NYC  I match with dudes and then   messages later the convo fizzles    months later we match again  If plans are discussed it s a dude trying to get me to come to his place without even having a coffee first  What is happening   I just want someone to take me for a drink  
Reddit,Trend I ve noticed with POC men on dating subreddits,ETA  I welcome all the downvotes  I still stand by what I said  Yeah this title is coming in hot so bare with me   I ve been noticing an uptick of posts from POC men complaining about getting zero matches or meeting people IRL  They claim that their profiles are solid  they re attractive  etc etc  But one important detail that s almost always left out  or at least hidden  is how these men are exclusively going after women outside their race  or white women   This is a HUGE factor in dating  The whole narrative that good women do not like these men is getting pretty old  POC men-you re      allowed your preferences  But please don t try and deceive pretend that you don t understand why you arent getting many matches or act like all women are shallow and dont like you  You are limiting yourself to a small subset of women  You cannot be surprised why you d have fewer matches    Let s just put it out there-in the western world  white men and women are seen as top beauty standard and really just top everything  That means white women have every group of men trying to get with them  Which means  more competition  And to add to that  most races date within their race  including white people  THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT  What I m trying to say is  you re competing for a subset of women who have their own men to pick from  plus a bunch of POC men vying for them as well  You CANNOT be surprised then that you aren t rolling in matches   I m mainly making this post cause I feel a lot of these posts from many POC men have been deceptive lately  They will purposely leave out that they are only going for white women  but make it seem like ALL women find them undesirable which simply isn t true  You usually have to drag it out of them in the comments   TO BE CLEAR ONCE AGAIN  It s FINE to have interracial preferences  Date who you want  But don t act surprised when you aren t rolling in matches    Before anyone comes for me  I am Black and I also have an out of race preference that I have already been upfront about in posts in the dating subs 
Reddit,Follow up or no ,Tl Dr   woman never got back to me about her schedule after agreeing to a first date  Follow up or trust my gut and let it go   I    M  connected with a woman    F  on the JDate app  At her request  we talked on the phone Wednesday this past week  We had a great conversation and without realizing spoke for almost   hours  I asked about getting together soon  first date   She said yes   this Saturday might work or Sunday before a late afternoon wedding she was attending  We left it that she d keep me posted once she figured out which was better for her  and I d plan everything from there  It s now late Sunday and I ve not heard from her   I take people at their word but judge them by their actions  In that context  this woman either isn t interested or is flaky unreliable  Neither is a good first impression  obviously  But until this point the woman has been communicative and responsive  etc  Still  my gut is telling me just let it go and move on  Am I being too rigid  Should I just reach out and ask what s up  Maybe there was a simple misunderstanding or miscommunication 
Reddit,Is this normal ,Talking to this guy and he gives me his snap  I tell him I don t have it  he unmatched me  Is that a normal thing  Do I need to use snap to talk to people  I only use Instagram when it comes to social media 
Reddit,Women  what are the reasons you delay text replies ,As a man who is secure  I have never delayed replies to women I am dating who have texted me  Typically several hours is the most I will go without responding to someone  Trying to elicit a psychological response from someone you are considering to be a partner in life seems sociopathic to me  Besides  being busy   which is nonsense - everyone knows we are all glued to our phones half of the day  what are the honest reasons why you have delayed a reply to a man that you have gone on multiple dates with for at least   days    Update - the conclusion of the related story was low interest  other options and a liar   The silver lining is that there are other  sometimes great fish in the sea   Choose people who consistently choose you  
Reddit,Why do women continually select violent  abusive men especially when they aren t even attractive ,You see countless posts and stories by girls starting with  I finally left my abusive ex  and how they had  gone back to them for the last time  yet women claim they  just want a nice guy     Something doesn t add up  If you question this unusual pattern of behavior you get told you are  victim blaming   that not ONE of these women could have  ever possibly seen  that these men were abusive up front  That they lured them in by being so sweet and only became toxic later in the relationship blah blah    Meanwhile you see an equal number of posts by women with memes joking about their shit taste in men to the tune of  how many red flags before you become elligible to date me  and  red flags  Check  Emotional baggage  Check   If these guys were all good looking and had plenty of other redeeming qualities I would understand it  but they don t  They are usually average ugly in appearance and sell dime bags out of their mom s basement or fat rednecks who haven t shaved in   years and have a family of birds living in their face pubes   So which is it  Obviously plenty of them seek guys like this out  and then are either upset when they couldn t  change  them or actually need that drama and toxicity as it keeps them on their toes  Even the ones who truly were simply  duped  seem to show a pattern of behavior in their selection    I think the dishonesty is really staggering   When men call them out on their bullshit they get fiercely defensive  first sign of being wrong  and immediately hurl insults at them to deflect from their pathetic behavior like  victim blamer  or  incel  it s really a joke     Then the worst part is that  violence  and abuse are the two main issues feminists claim to be fighting to eradicate  Is there any logic in any of this nonsense 
Reddit,Why have match settings if the app isn t going to use them ,Is it just me or are all these apps getting worse and worse in just their basic functions   For example  match criteria  Pretty much every single one shows me people outside my match criteria  They show me people  outside of distance  age  race  etc    It could be due to my area which is very rural so there may not be many people to show  but it s just wasting my time showing people outside of settings    What s worse is they mix people within my settings with people outside  They should put all the people that match my settings first at least  Then put in ones that don t after 
Reddit,Older men on dating sites,I m attracted to older men my ex was    years older than me  then i met one guy online who is    years older than me  which was another immature individual  I ve come to notice that some of these older men is only the apps to play  Their profiles clearly states they are looking for something real and permanent  but the moment we start chatting i can sense that they are only on there for ir quick fun  Now I m wondering am i the problem or are they themselves just confused and don t know what they want  I m starting to think the dating apps is just not for me and it s best to just not focus on finding that one  Wait for the unexpected   
Reddit,I DID IT  I did it  I finally went on a date with one of those people that is just there to waste time ,You know who I m talking about  It s     of the accounts on every app  They text aimlessly for weeks  constantly punt in-person dates  make bizarre excuses not to FaceTime  weeks-long pauses  ghosting  account disappears  reappears  they re-engage  disappear again  You get it  I went on a date with one of them  It really happened   First off  since this is going to be a takedown piece  because all of my worst assumptions were essentially confirmed   I just want to say that I was extremely kind  sweet and reaffirming on this date  At no point was I rude or snide or anything like that  I handled it as I would any first date and we left on excellent terms   We texted for a while a year ago  Had a lot in common  I had fun getting to know her  I set up a coffee date straight away  A few hours before  excuse  No worries  reschedule  continue chatting  Punts again  FaceTime  Sure  Weird excuse  We text for a while longer and at this point I m sure it s pointless  but I wanted to see how far this person would take it  We texted for about another month  and she set a FIRM date for us to get coffee  Morning of  I walk to my car  open the door  then get a notification  She s taking a break from the apps and canceling our date  Her profile vanishes  Lol  I knew it  Forget about it immediately and move on   Two weeks ago  I get a text  It s her  She re-joined the apps and saw my new location was in the same neighborhood as her new apartment  Crazy  She wants to meet up  Sure  She punts  Punts again  Excuse  Punt  Last night  she texts me after work  and says we can meet at this cafe in our neighborhood  I m walking there  she calls me and cancels  I tell her it s A-okay  there s no pressure  I promise I m very nice and we can just chat for a few minutes and leave it at that  She agrees  She shows up    She s about    pounds heavier than her pictures  No problem  We get drinks  we start talking  She has  Nothing to talk about  I know she s nervous  so I m trying to be self-effacing  trying to make her feel comfortable  But she just has nothing to talk about  Unclear what she does for work and she doesn t want to get into it  Unclear what her educational background is and she doesn t want to get into it  She loves kids  can t wait to have them  She has virtually no interests  She doesn t watch television  She doesn t read  No podcasts  no musical interests  no comedians  no radio  no old VHS or family stories passed down the grapevine  no sports  activities  recreations  nada  She s got nothing  She is a charisma black hole  She has the charisma of one of those child safety doorknob covers they sell in packs at Home Depot  She doesn t laugh  At anything  She doesn t even smile  She can t make eye contact  Then  as with seemingly all bad dates  she starts talking about her faith  If this date is a pre-owned      Ford Fiesta  it has collided with the guardrail and is now spinning out of control  She s VERY into her faith  Her faith is basically all there is to her  It s all-consuming  It s all she wants to talk about now  No mention of it on her profile or prior mention from when we were texting  of course  No no  She loves Jesus  LOVES Jesus  She would raw dog Jesus on the spot if they hadn t nailed him to that  T  way back when  The Ford Fiesta that is this date is now rolling  All of the airbags have deployed  a state trooper just pulled up and said  Mother of god  under his breath and I ve been thrown clear  mere moments from joining ol  J-dog in the sky  I call it  It s been half an hour of sheer pain and I call it  I tell her it was a lot of fun and thank her so much for coming out  We hug  I smile   I limp back to my apartment  mortally wounded  but filled with the kind of adrenaline and inner peace that only comes from the knowledge that every single one of those people on the apps is probably in whatever weird  hellish cult she is and they genuinely are all bullets that we  usually  mercifully dodge

Reddit,There s something going on with Photofeeler ,Hi  folks  So  I ve been usin Photofeeler for about a year to try to improve my Bumble Tinder profiles  I get some pretty great dates from time to time  but definitely feel I could get more matches with better photos  My better photos used to be in the    -    attractive range on Photofeeler  and I m trying to get an    so I take some photos every once in a while and test them    Thing is  I feel I ve been improving my photo skills  but my new pics actually got worse scores  Last time I used Photofeeler  no matter what I did  I wouldn t get more than a   on attractiveness    I was a bit confused with the results  so I tried something  I retested some of my older pics  To further my confusion  all of them got     to     points lower on attractive than what they got a few monts ago  A     went down to a      a     became a      a     went all the way down to a          All of them had what the site considers a fairly reliable sample size  at leat    votes     What gives  Anyone had the same experience  Did Photofeeler voters got way harsher  Is It still reliable  Was it ever reliable to begin with  lol
Reddit,Messaging someone you went on a two dates with   months ago,     f  went on two very good dates with a guy  m    back in July  We ended up hooking up as well but there was a lot of chemistry and I think we both had a great time  He then went on a family trip for two weeks and our texts ended with him leaving me on read  However the convo was definitely getting dry considering he was away for two weeks and I think that was partially my fault for not putting effort into keeping the convo engaging  Anyways  a few weeks after that was my birthday and he ended up messaging me to wish me a happy birthday  It had been a few weeks since we talked and I was a bit salty about how he had left me on read before so I just liked the message and didn t continue the conversation  Now a few months later and he still likes my social media posts and views my stories and I can t help but think I could ve tried to keep the convo going  I think we kind of mutually drifted away from each other but I kind of get the vibe that he would be down to hang out again if I ask  But I m worried that might come across as desperate or weird  I don t know what to do  I need advice 
Reddit,Should I move on from this current thing ,Hi so I m a    year old man and this past October I developed a crush on a close friend and they reciprocated but there s a distance between us  literally they re a state over lmao  but lately I just been feeling dumb for even saying anything and just swallowing my feelings   At first they said they didn t want to online date  which is totally fine  and i rebutted with us both being adults with jobs it wouldn t be an issue visiting but again I totally understand and wouldn t want to strong arm them or anything like that  so that was the end of that conversation but I think I failed to follow up with  should I just move on  to them because I m not sure on what to do  They still talk about people they find attractive and what not and lately the communication between us has slowed but that s not unexpected since they re in college and have a job with their break but idk I still feel like I ve been stupid this little stint and want some second third  fourth opinions  Thanks in advance

Reddit,He asked for his money back after I told him I didn t feel a connection,Yesterday I  nicely  told a guy from Hinge that I didn t think it would work out with us  We went on two dates  the first one we split and the second he paid  He responded with asking me for the     he spent on my food and told me I conned him into paying  I was so confused because he never even gave me the opportunity to pay  he just did before I could say anything  I blocked his number and he sent me a huge angry message from another number  I suspect he signed me up for something because right after that I started receiving tons of spam texts and calls  one right after another  Lesson learned  I will not be giving out my phone number any more  This is the second time someone has used my number after I have blocked them 
Reddit,The word  vibe  on OLD is getting out of control,I used to not mind it but recently it s getting annoying  Nearly every profile says vibe this and vibe that and then in messages it s  meet up and see if we vibe  lol  I m somewhat kidding but it s got to be the most overused word in OLD  Anyone else seeing this

Reddit,Sick of the Instaghost,I    M  already struggle enough to get likes and matches which has destroyed the little self-esteem I still had left from my break-up  but then on top of that there are sooooooo many times where when I finally match with someone I say something  they respond  I say a second thing and they either don t respond or respond two or three more times and then just never respond again   And it s not like I m saying weird stuff or asking for anything sexual or anything  Then I d understand  No  it s just starting a conversation about stuff like shared interests I saw on their profile or hobbies we both have or whatever   It just makes me think all of this is impossible  I found my previous   girlfriends via dating apps  but right now I just feel like I m never going to find anyone again  At least not unless I settle for someone I don t actually want to be with   I m just so sick of this  Sick of feeling like trash about my previous girlfriend  Sick of getting so few matches and feeling like trash about that  Sick of getting my hopes up when I finally get a match only to then be ghosted almost instantly   I thought online dating was supposed to make things easier but it just feels like torture to me   I just want to find a wonderful woman close to my age who s creative and enthousiastic  who loves reading  culture  romance and who s sweet and emotional and empathetic  Someone to spend the rest of my life with   But I m so tired of all the swiping and ghosting 
Reddit,My    hour rule ,OK so a general rule of thumb I use when talking to someone is if they can t text me back with in    hours  i am done caring and moving on    Generally once I have your number or snap I have already deleted you off the app  I do this because revenge reporting is a thing and I would like to avoid that  I have had some salty guys that probably would have done it    Anyway  I know people are busy but with how attached people are to their phones there is no excuse for not even one response within    hours  If this happens  I don t delete there number or block them  I just stop trying and putting in the effort  I just start talking to other people    If they want to contact me they can and I will gladly respond if I am still into them but I just stop giving a damn  One person can only put in so much effort without getting anything back    My time is valuable and I am not going to let a dude waist it and make me wait by the phone 
Reddit,Is anyone else bumping into hustlers lately ,I mean I matched with two women  the first one within   minutes of chatting wants me to send her money cause she hadn t ate the entire day     the other one wanted to come over with her sister and her sister s child to come cook       I was like WTF
Reddit,Did anyone go back to a person who ghosted you and asked why  Result  Regret doing it ,We re both in our late   s  almost     So I assumed this person was mature enough to let me know if not interested in me  But I got ghosted  It s been about a month and I have gone on dates with other people but it s become  unsolved mystery   I have this urge to text this person to ask  hey  remember me  It s fine if you didn t like me  But just curious what it was that you don t like about me  What was so bad  to not even kindly let me know that you don t want to go out again with me     Has anyone done this  Maybe more aggressively or nicely  Any result  Heard back  Do you regret texting and asking this   ---- EDIT  a lot of wise and grateful answers here  Thank you all    
Reddit,what is OLD ,I am new to online dating  well dating in general   I am   F and never had a relationship  I have tried Bumble for a week  Match and Coffee meets Bagel for a week  but I lose interest because  no one responds  if they do respond they say one thing and ghost me  and it is too expensive to maintain if nothing is happening  also I kind of feel guilty swiping left on people who do not catch my eye   I know that with online dating you have to have a nice face to reel people in  but I do have a decent face  Can anyone recommend some dating sites or do I need to stick it out and use the apps I already have   P S  It seems that everybody is thinking that I am lusting after men who are way out of my league  what I am saying is that dating apps are designed for really hot people and I am not  I know there are some men who are just crazy good looking and there are women who are crazy good looking and they are going to go for each other rather than someone like me  I do take the time to talk to some of the guys who message me and I do read men s profiles to see if I have anything in common with them  After we start talking  they sometimes stop talking to me and that is probably because they found someone who may be more attractive 
Reddit,Is anyone else doing Tinder s recs mode for single friends  and all the guys  profiles are impossibly perfect ,My single female friend    F  NYC  just gave me a link to do recommendation mode for her  She s dipping her toe back into the dating pool  she s great  she works as a theater director  just made herself a new Tinder profile  And she activated the new  friend recommendation mode  so that I could have fun as a friend swiping for her  Tinder showed me    profiles for her  all men in the   -   age range  and then said  come back in    hours         These guys are   all   the total package  Tall  crazily handsome  multiple championship athletes with the bodies to match  all working in elite professions  doctor  finance  tech  etc  but with important hobbies passions as well  they mostly say they re looking for something serious meaningful or at least are without obvious red flags  even when I go to their instagram and start poking around         At first  I thought it might just be the Tinder algorithm prioritizing a new feature that they want everyone to embrace  so putting the  best  dudes at the top of the feed  But she said that the profiles I selected don t seem out of line from her normal queue         Is this just    what dudes are like  on Tinder in your   s in NYC now   Why are all my   something female friends telling me that dating is crazy hard in NYC  if they re just bombarded with unrealistic-for-a-romcom-movie level male options on the apps     
Reddit,I came up with a new rule to OLD the   day rule,I have wasted so much time getting to know people  trying to keep them interested  answering and asking the questions  sharing stories  being witty and humorous  fun and appealing only to watch it all burn out like a damn meteor falling to earth that now I m enforcing the   day rule  If the person is not ready and willing to meet within   days of messaging then I m out   unmatcjh   pass   punt   kick  whatever   No more wasting time  Have a great weekend 
Reddit,I don t want to make out on the street on a first date,I m really just wondering if other women have this issue  Almost every guy I go on a first date with wants to make out at the end of the date in public on the street  First I m    and I would think we would be beyond this at my age  This has happened to me after a    minute coffee date  this happens after an hour or two with only one drink  this is not happening after prolonged heavy nights of drinking    I always tell these guys during texting that I m looking for a relationship  confirm that they are looking for the same  I tell them I would like to move slow in the beginning and get to know someone - I really try to set the stage that I m not hooking up with somebody on a first few dates  But it never fails that at the end of the first date they go in for a kiss on a public street where people are walking by and shove their tongue down my throat  I think a hug is acceptable  a peck on the cheek ok  even a peck on the lips if there s huge vibes I can go for  but they go for the full on make out with tongue  Even when I m in a relationship  I don t want someone s tongue down my throat in public where people are looking at us  it s just not my style  and anyone meeting me can tell that about me that I m a little bit private    I am the type of person who will accept a date fairly quickly and say yeah we don t need to text forever  let s meet in person and just chat and see how it goes so it s also not like I ve built up this long connection with these guys in advance either  If I reject the kiss  I will never hear from them again  which in most cases I don t want to anyway after  so what usually happens is they go in for the kiss  start to put the tongue in  and then I pull away  Then they are usually butt hurt    So is this just my experience or do other women have this experience   It s frustrating because I m trying to be open to just go on dates and get to know people without killing everybody by text first but it s like they think I by committing to a coffee date I m committing to making out and it just makes me so uncomfortable  It s getting to the point where now I don t even want to go on dates because I don t want to make out with a stranger 
Reddit,What do woman look for under the bio section ,Trying to improve my profile  Really curious what woman look for in the bio part of a profile 
Reddit,My self-esteem is shot,I    m  have been trying online dating for a year now with no luck  I ve had    matches out of     messages sent  and   dates that led to  I d rather be friends   On paper I m a catch  no kids  no crazy exes  well educated and successful career  My problem is I m squarely average looking  I ve put a ton of pictures on photofeeler and they are always  s for attractiveness but  -   for smart and trustworthy  So I thought maybe my profile is terrible and tried an experiment that destroyed any self confidence I had   I created an exact replica of my profile  but with pictures of a more handsome man  Not model handsome but a solid    The amount of likes and messages I got was astonishing  I didn t do any swiping or initiate anything and I had    messages in the first week  I didn t respond to any of them because I m not going to catfish someone  but I got my answer on what is wrong with my profile and it is soul crushing

Reddit,Should I go on dates with people I m not attracted to ,I ve been online dating for a year and I ve been on over a hundred first dates  Out of those     I was only attracted  physically  mentally  etc   to one  and he ended up not wanting a relationship  Am I doing this wrong  I heard that attraction is supposed to grow over time but it doesn t feel possible in this arena because when I meet someone in the dating context and I feel nothing  I get a really bad feeling that makes me want to stay far away from the person  It seems like we either have compatibility or attraction but never both  Do people go on dates with people they don t feel excited about and then suddenly feel attraction later  Again I don t just mean physical but it is one factor of many  Am I doing something wrong  I feel like I m losing my mind 
Reddit,Why do women take so long to reply and ghost me ,It seems that however much effort I put into online dating  it s never reciprocated  I am a rather low value male granted  but every time I try to message women and ask about them with curiosity they take forever to reply and when they finally do they ghost me after a period of time  rinse and repeat    The obvious answer is to go out and meet people irl and I know that  just wondering what I m doing wrong here   Update  decided not to date and focus on self improvement  also I learned the term from the fresh and fit podcast

Reddit,Suggestions on how to handle a vindictive match posting false info in a  Are We Dating the Same Guy  FB group,First time posting here  looking for some advice and perhaps a common experience and how others handled would handle this   I matched with a girl on Bumble at the end of August and went out with her a handful of times for about a month before telling her that I didn t see things going long term and  what I thought was  respectfully ending things and wishing her the best in the future  She did not take it well  but it was done and I thought that was that   I ve just come to find out through a friend that this girl posted me in one of those  Are We Dating the Same Guy   private facebook groups and completely falsified an entire post about me  saying that we dated for over a year  I am a cheater  alcoholic  etc  at the end of October  Of course she did it anonymously  but there were enough things in the post I was able to reference that it is      her  Not to mention I wasn t even aware these pages existed until this girl showed me them while we were talking   I am not sure what recourse I have here  if any  I asked my friend to report the post  though I don t know how much that will do   There are over         people on this page  and this now has me questioning if some matches I ve had since then that started off with great conversation suddenly stopped because they looked me up on this page and saw this false post   Not really sure what to expect  but wanted to get this out there and see if anyone has any suggestions or anything  Thanks for reading     x   B 
Reddit,I quit OLD  I just learned I m in one of those  don t date him  pages on Facebook ,I m disgusted that this has happened  I m not perfect but I don t deserve online infamy    We are all the protagonists of our own stories   Nobody sees themselves as the bad guy  But I learned I have been painted as villain in a FB group in the city I live in by women I ve talked with and dated on OLD  I Went on a  nd date with a great girl  Went fantastic  We planned a  rd   Next day she texted me saying she wants to end it because she saw my picture on a Facebook group she follows   That if I pissed off all these girls I m not worth the risk    I m like  wtf    She was the only one I was talking to   To be fair  I had been on a first date previously this week with another girl but she wasn t my type   I dragged my feet being forthright with her but before I could she texted me a loooooooong message criticizing and insulting me  because she noticed my texting pattern changed  so I blocked her   I m not perfect  but I m guessing she was the recent post the other girl saw     Apparently multiple posts have been made about me since I started dating in San Antonio   months ago  Saying how I am a ghoster  I m not looking for a real relationship  how I m rude etc    I recognized a few of the scenarios of being bad dates I had during the year  But they were perverted details designed to make me look worse than I remember       This is a group banned to men  And this girl  who I wanted to date but had just ended it  was kind enough to send me some screen shots  All women who post about men anonymous but they are allowed to show a pic of the man they want to complain about  me  with a small black bar across my eyes    One scenario posted  posted by anonymous  screenshot  was by a woman I remember vividly due to the details  It was the date from hell  She lied about having kids  her weight   shockingly introduced me to her whole family  and drank   beers and   margaritas during a   hour date to my   beers  I remember  being very uncomfortable around her    She posted negative  false things about me  I do not agree with her post framing me as rude and judgemental    Let me be clear   I ve talked to many women on OLD   But I have been only met in person about   -     I only had one girl that lasted longer than one date  about a   week relationship and she was the only one I kissed and slept with  she ended it to pursue stronger feelings for another guy     I ve not slept with anyone else since moving here  I have not kissed anyone little more than a grandma lip kiss at the end of a date  I paid for all dates    Some girls liked me more than I liked them and vice versa   It happens    Some girls ghosted me  Some of them it was a  mutual ghosting  past asking if they made it home safe after the date    I m not perfect  I ve made mistakes   I try to be forthright with every girl but I have ghosted girls that I felt really uncomfortable  and unsafe  with   Possibly some ghosting was me being a coward that I can t remember   But nothing escalated past a normal first date    But these posts about me and how I date   I don t feel comfortable with any of it   These  scorned  girls can make up anything they want to ruin my reputation with impunity    I don t know what to think    On one hand    I m clearly the common denominator and need to rethink my approach and dating style  I want to find love    I don t want to hurt anyone  I don t want to be seen as someone you shouldn t date   I m glad a resource like this exists to warn women of abusive men and cheaters    On the other hand   Im a normal  harmless  single man  I m not a cheater  I m not an abuser  I should be free to set my own dating boundaries without fear of being put on a wall of shame and harassed    I have never shamed any woman who s rejected me  ghosted me by posting their photos online and fabricating lies    I am not a threat   I am a simple man using OLD to find love and being unfairly shamed in an escalated unfair way    I find it hard not to see these women as petty girls who can t handle rejection     It s all one sided stories  But these posts just cost me a really great girl    I really liked her  She was amazing and made me feel butterflies again   She dumped me due to me being a scumbag celebrity   The anonymity these women are allowed with posting my pictures and likeness for defamation irks me     But that s why I quit  Clearly I pissed off these women  Clearly I am the common denominator  I need to rethink things   But I never imagined dating like this    I m tired and exhausted   I m disgusted I m seen this way    I always thought of myself as unlucky in dating  But this is something else entirely    My character is all I have  I pride the respect I give to everyone  But now I m scared of dating  That I m one miscommunication or polite   not feeling it   away from being publicly shamed on a website that deters others from me

Reddit,Hesitant to start OLD,Hello everyone  I m a   m located on LI  outside of NYC  Long story short  I have social anxiety and issues with depression in the past  Most women who I dated in the past were long distance or in college  I never used the apps  All I ve been seeing are horror stories about users complaining that they are not getting noticed at all  it s draining all their self-confidence and value  etc  Look  I ve been working on myself for a long time to overcome my depression and manage my anxiety with therapy and such    I honestly didn t think I had enough value to offer someone else until recently  I m proud of my work  but I had to put dating on hold for a while  I want to find a long-term partner  but I don t want these apps tanking my self-confidence if I don t succeed at first or at all  lol 
Reddit,I deleted all of my dating apps  It s time to take a real break this time ,I m writing this to hold myself accountable in front of millions of strangers  but also to maybe let someone out there know that they re not alone   I m currently     and ever since I was     it feels like I ve been ruled by the desire to have a relationship  I love the idea of love  and I ve always wanted it more than anything else in this world  Most of my friends and family are in happy  healthy relationships  and I ve been waiting for that to be me one day too  Two years ago  I ended a relationship with a wonderful person  and although our life goals didn t align  I ve been chasing that feeling of being loved and being in love ever since   I have been addicted to dating apps  stopping only during my two relationships and getting right back on them after a very short and unhealthy healing period  This year has been the worst year of dating for me by far  I ended a short toxic relationship in January  and since then it s been a long line of either  them not being interested  me not being interested  lying about they re looking for  using me for sex  or having a great conversation over the apps and zero chemistry in person    As soon as it didn t work out with one match  I would just get right back on the apps and replace them with someone new  There are so many memories in my life that look back on and realize that those times were soured because I was talking to a guy  or getting over my most recent dating failure  I wasn t happy unless I was talking to someone  or unless they responded   This is incredibly toxic and unhealthy behaviour  and I knew that a long time ago  but I just couldn t stop it  I kept thinking that if I just got a boyfriend  everything would be okay  but that s a huge burden to put on someone  After another failed first date tonight  I ve decided that I m starting      off by deleting my dating apps  for real this time  I ve tried to do this in the past and lasted maybe a couple of weeks  but I m challenging myself to take at least a year off  maybe more  maybe forever  I need to learn how to be comfortable on my own and stop letting the successes and failures of my dating life dictate my entire mood and life  It ll be a big adjustment not talking to someone or searching for someone to talk to       and I ll no doubt have intense fomo whenever I look at my friends who are in love  but I ve finally accepted that this is something I have to do   Right now  it s hard to believe I ll ever find true love  but I know I ll never find it with my current behaviour  If you ve read this all the way through  thank you so much for helping to hold this Reddit stranger accountable

Reddit,Ladies  would you be comfortable if the guy tries to kiss you on the second date ,Got a few new likes on Hinge recently  I ignored them for a few days but decided to like back one   Went on a date with her   days ago after messaging for a week  Usually I d go for the kiss on the first date but she made a comment about how she wouldn t kiss someone on the first date so I internalized that comment and refrained from attempting to lmao  The context was about her female friends situation    I drove her home that night  we hugged and went parted    We ve been talking everyday and she tells me how much she s been enjoying speaking with me  She replies insanely quick  Like within   minutes or less everyday  She is also the one to initiate convos   She said she wants to see me tomorrow and I am just curious if you guys think I should go for the kiss  Do you think she d accept it   Or should I wait 
Reddit, The only people who like me are people who I don t find attractive  ,I feel like this is such a common theme I see with dating apps   The only people who like me are people who I don t like   This usually means that they don t find them attractive  or they think they can do way better than them    Is it that people think they re better looking than they are  Is it people having unrealistic standards  Is it that the dating pool is just that bad 
Reddit,Matched with a girl who stood me up earlier this year,Back in February I matched with a girl on Hinge  After talking for a few days  we made plans to meet up at a wine bar  I took a Lyft there because I don t fuck with DUI s  When I got out of the Lyft and opened the app to tell her I was there she was no longer in my matches  We never exchanged numbers so I couldn t text her  I had found her last name on my own time and from there her other socials but I didn t think it would be wise to contact her on there   More than anything I was pissed that she made me waste money on Lyfts and made me skip a raid hour on Pokemon Go  Well just now I matched with her on The League  I haven t messaged her yet  It is not clear if she even remembers me  Should I even bother talking to her  Should I bring up the incident from earlier this year   She is a divorce lawyer if that means anything 
Reddit,Facebook Dating - friendships,So I m just asking for opinions here   I d signed up to Facebook dating about a year ago  Not even used it until today    So today went on and went through the people that liked me  Actually wasn t really interested in anyone  Liked a couple back as I was borderline attracted to them and some of their interests and vibe was a decent match  But ultimately probably not compatible enough   Then looked at friendship and the very first one was hot af and totally what I like  The next one I d definitely date too  I ve not even gone through the rest yet    So question  I can t see whether they re straight or gay  I m assuming straight just from their look  Can they see if I m gay or not  It doesn t say on my profile but it s in my preferences  Will it only match you if both gay or for friendship will it match anyone   I don t understand the concept of a hot interesting guy that would have lots of friends most likely messaging someone for friendship  Especially a gay guy that would probably think they re very hot and would maybe want to date them  if they can even see that though   My profile on there looks a bit actionish so I guess he could assume similar interests    I must admit the hookup sites I ve been on for years have totally warped my expectations of normal behaviour and am having sex with a lot of straight men from them   But I think Facebook dating probably has different norms and expectations  Now it s a stranger and it won t be a big loss to say something silly as I can just move on  but I d rather not embarrass myself   Does friendship actually mean friendship on Facebook dating  I d put friendship on there myself but it was not really meant in the classical sense  More friends that I go places with and do things with but there is attraction there and we have sex too - i e  Kind of a fuck buddy  I mean people go onto dating sites not so much for friendships in the totally traditional sense but something a bit more don t they    I don t want to embarrass myself and don t understand the rules  Help lol
Reddit,As a guy  how can I appropriately respond to everyone being a Swiftie ,This is more a joke prompt but I ve seen it everywhere  It seems like every other girl mentions being a massive Swift fan on their account  I m not judging  her music is fine  even though it s not for me  But for whatever reason  every avenue Ive taken to try and engage with it  what about your music speaks to you  favorite songs  what s the appeal  etc  seem to fall flat or not go anywhere  I m pretty good at holding convos even when I don t know about something  so I m surprised this keeps happening  Doesn t help that the best I can engage with is her relationship with Kelce  but that s only cause Im a Chiefs fan   Not gonna claim I can t get matches because of it  but I d genuinely like to know how to better myself  Guys  do you all have ways of navigating this hurdle  Are you also encountering this problem  Swifties  do you want us to be subjugated by your fandom  Gimme homework

Reddit,Don t take it personal,I don t care if you are average  above average or handsome  Majority of women on dating apps are there for the laughs or validation  that s why they usually have that lukewarm or shitty attitude   I ve had many women talk to me first after matching  telling me how handsome I am  that I look like a model to then dissapear forever from the app  Unless your match makes some effort and has at least some resemblance to a real human being and not a NPC  treat it like a number  You ll thank me later   Good luck 
Reddit,Is Roast worth paying for ,I m just wondering if anyone out there has used Roast to critique their profiles and photos and if they actually give good advice that works and will get me likes  matches and dates or if I would be wasting my money paying for it  Any thoughts 
Reddit,Are paid apps better than free apps ,I ve never gotten much attention from using free apps  like Tinder  Bumble  Hinge  etc and I m wondering if I would be more likely to get a date with a paid app  like eHarmony or Match com   My understanding of how the free apps work is that they re designed to make the users frustrated  They re designed so that men outnumber women  that only the top     of attractive men get quality matches  and that  even with a good profile in place there s still a chance that you won t get likes matches  simply because your profile isn t even showing up on those peoples  profiles  Are the paid apps designed the same way  or are they designed better because if you re having to pay that means you deserve quality service and a non-frustrating online dating experience  I d maybe consider myself average-looking  and I think at this point I d be looking for a long-term partner  Is it worth me using a paid app  or will I run into the same difficulties with online dating on the paid apps that I m having on the free apps 
Reddit,On Tinder  do swipes and Super Likes register if one clicks into a profile via profiles URL ,Context  So I ve came across a few profiles that I wanted to like or Super Like but couldn t either because I used up all of my swipes and used a Super Like  If I save their URL for later until I get more swipes or Super Likes again  will swiping right or using a Super Like register   I asked because I thought that I saw one profile after Super Liking it via using said profiles URL rather than finding it the normal way   Any help explaining this would be much appreciated  Thanks 
Reddit,I rarely ever find someone who s my type on dating apps,It s discouraging and honestly getting boring  it s not like I don t see people in person that I m attracted to but the people that end up showing up on my dating apps aren t people I find interesting and my type
Reddit,Those of you that went from completely unsuccessful to successful  what change did you make ,When I say successful  I don t mean finding a relationship  I am talking about simply getting matches and dating  Unsuccessful would obviously be pretty much no matches and no dates  
Reddit,If Instagram had a dedicated dating section would you prefer it over traditional dating apps ,If Instagram had some type of dating section feature like how Facebook does but more flushed out and not constantly showing me people from     miles away I honestly don t know if I would still use things like Tinder or Bumble  I feel like it would be so much easier to use that to date because you could easily figure out good conversation starters and common interests by their posts instead of being relegated to  -   photos an a bio  Plus the dating pool would be bigger cause more people have Instagram than dating apps  For reference Instagram has     Billion monthly users  Tinder has    million      What do you guys think  Would you still use Tinder or other apps if that was the case 
Reddit,Why is online dating so hard for average men  I see so many balding fat men with attractive  fit partners ,Feel free to look back at a post of mine with a photo of myself  I posted a photo on another subreddit as I m struggling to get any matches and just wanted to see where I stood  Turns out I m average which I m ok with   Also  I ve read so many posts on here from average  and even slightly above average  guys who get   matches as well  It s really gotten me thinking lately as when I m out in public  I see so many men around my age  mid to late thirties  who are fat with massive guts  A lot of them also have severe male pattern baldness yet they have these smoking hot partners  GFs or wives   Nothing against fat or bald guys but those are two things that I consider a negative instead of a positive   So yeah  guys in the   to   range struggle to get   match on Tinder yet you have all these guys who are subpar physically but they are in relationships with women who are far more attractive than themselves  Is it charisma  humour  money

Reddit,What biases stereotypes do you follow when OLDing ,What do you see on a dating app that immediately makes you say hell no    I ll start      Red hats- I immediately think that you are a Trump supporter      Fake name- I think that you are married and trying to hide from your spouse       MAGA mustache- see number        Self employed- I think you don t have a job or sell drugs      No face pics- see number        Way too sexy of pics- you may be fake or only looking for one thing      Pictures with masks- you haven t taken a picture since        I know all of this makes me sound extremely judgmental  It probably limits me from meeting a really great person as well  But I think we all have biases and it s fun to discuss them  Don t hate me 
Reddit,Ladies  how do you feel when a man puts they are divorced in their profile ,Is that something they should put in their profile or rather bring up and not include it but indicate it after matching with someone and then talking  
Reddit,First phone call video call,Hi  I m not actually in a long distance relationship but I ve been using a dating app and met this man  We ve only been talking since November  He mentioned he s been going out on dates that obviously didn t go well  so I honestly assume that he still does and I still see him being online on the dating app everytime I check  I once asked if he wanted to talk about the bad weekend he told me and he asked if I feel like talking on the phone  I want to talk with him on the phone eventually too  but I said I m a bit shy  English is not our first language so it s going to be so awkward  I feel so nervous and I don t feel like I m really not comfortable speaking it  He then asked me the next day if I m okay to do it while doing his work  I m still not ready  I have to go elsewhere because I don t want my family hearing me speaking with someone  I told him I ll probably try to call him next week when I go out  It will be my first time talking to a foreigner on the phone  I m so nervous  I ve never been in a relationship  I m in my late   s and I m trying to freaking do this  Hahaha    I d appreciate your thoughts on this  Thank you    
Reddit,Guys that deleted OLD are you still searching for relationships  where are you ended up looking for relationships,I m    M  honestly so sick of OLD but can t quit if I don t have kind of a back up plan   I have way too many people IRL  say they meet their love in a church  How s that even possible   Also give me options to go from here on out about where to date without OLD     Thanks much appreciated 
Reddit,Do I have a stalker ,I    M  meet a woman    F   online in june  We really hit it off  and I saw a lot of potential  A lot of free-flowing conversation  humor  long phone calls until all hours of the evening  etc  This lasted for a week  During one of the last phone conversations we had  I mentioned some things but I m completely fine with or like to do  that she definitely did not want to take part in  Like being silly in public and drawing attention to yourself  Get your minds out of the gutter   The next day she sent me a series of texts  where in the midst of saying nice things and complimenting me  she also mentioned that we maybe incompatible in our personalities  as well as our long-term relationship goals  She decided it it will be best to not continue talking  Her last message ended with   You re wonderful  but I m not the one for you   I was sad  but I made my peace with it and moved on   Flash forward to a week ago  She texted me out of the middle of nowhere and asked me how I m doing  We catch up briefly and eventually get into a conversation about loneliness and how the two of us have each been coping with it  I ve not really done much over the past few months  choosing to focus on self care for myself  She let me know that she went through a  hookup phase   where she slept with a few guys  I m guessing three or four though she didn t actually tell me the number  She regretted hooking up with these guys  as she didn t actually want to have sex  she just wanted physical contact and to be close to somebody  I remarked that I wish that I had the same  So we decided to help each other out  We set up a system by which I would spend maybe one or two nights a week at her place  just to have somebody physically there  Not for sex  though that would eventually happen as we got more comfortable with each other  We set up some rules  and we agreed to support each other in this way  The first night would be tonight  Thursday   The problem comes from the fact that we agreed to this a few nights ago  and then I had time to think  We ve never actually met in person  we ve only spoken on the phone and texted  Not a word between us for the last   months  and now we have this arrangement set up less than a week after connecting again  I m not a creeper  but we don t know each other well enough for her to be certain of that  our first time seeing each other in person will be at her house  for an overnight stay  And now today she s texted me to tell me that she has a bad cold  and had to stay home from work today  so it ll probably be important for us to postpone spending the night with each other  She seemed extremely sad about this  and remarked that she very badly wanted to see me tonight  When I asked what she meant by that  she said she s really excited  and wants to know what it will be like when we are finally face to face  Maybe I m paranoid  but I m feeling stalkerish type vibes  I don t want to turn down an attractive woman for no strings attached nights with her that will probably lead to sex  but I also don t want to wake up in the middle of the night with a knife in my chest   Sorry for the book  but I needed to set the stage  I also need to know  am I crazy to think these things  or is she just plain crazy 
Reddit,Asking about difference in photos ,Okay  so  Mullets are very popular with men in my generation  I cannot stand them  I think they re hideous  and they make anyone who has one look worse  This is just my opinion of course  and anyone who feels good with a mullet should keep it   BUT  So many of these dudes have a mix of photos with various hairstyles   sometimes including a mullet    It s a full on no for me  Would it be different if I was already in love  Yeah  obvi  But I can t get past it for initial attraction  Do y all swipe  Or ask

Reddit,Shirtless pics ,Is it wrong to have a shirtless pic if your physique is solid for men    I see women with nice bodies tend to post pics in bikinis  sometimes bra pics  etc  I know it can come off as kinda douchey for shirtless pic but idk if a guy has a solid physique - I think it s perfectly fine if not main pic and has a solid context  maybe pic at a beach  pool  etc  and not just a mirror selfie    Thanks for any thoughts 
Reddit,Girl asked to reschedule but didn t propose a new time - should I wait ,I was supposed to meet this girl I matched with on Hinge for our first date last Friday  but she asked to reschedule the morning of because she had a prior work commitment that she d forgotten about  She was very apologetic and said she d make it up to me  so I wasn t too annoyed although I was disappointed  The issue is that it s now Thursday and she still hasn t proposed a new time or offered to meet up  even though we ve still been texting once or twice a day about other random things  Should I ask her when she s free to meet or wait until she suggests it herself

Reddit,Advice for guy who hasn t reached out in a week post date,Had a great time and our date lasted all day  over   hours   He kept extending it throughout or date because he said he really enjoyed his time with me  Conversation flowed and there was chemistry flirtation  He messaged me after our date what a fun time he had and asked me out generally during our date but didn t solidify plans  Anyway he hasn t been on the app in a week so I haven t heard from him but I noticed today he logged in but updated his pics  Does this mean I should move on  Kinda bummed because I thought we hit it off but I was the last to message a week ago and now my chat is in the older chats section of the app  Any advice 
Reddit,How do you respond to one word replies ,Online dating is so annoying  It s like men don t even know how to have basic conversation  You ll say hi how are you and they will respond with  good   You ll ask what they do for work and they ll reply with one word  On top of that they don t ask any questions back  When is enough enough to actually decide to unmatch

Reddit,Height isn t the end all be all unless you let it be ,I recently matched with a guy and one of his first messages to me was that I was so tall he thought I was a giant and that it was one of the first things he noticed about my profile  For reference I am           cm  and he is the same height    This was immediately off putting as while I do realize that I am on the taller side  it s not usually the first thing that people notice and point out about me  I tried to point the conversation elsewhere but he just kept making the conversation about height and how tall I was  It eventually got to him admitting that he was insecure about his height  how he had always dreamed about being six feet tall  and how being      made it harder for him to date   I honestly don t think that being      makes it harder for him to date  I think his horrible attitude about it makes it harder for him to date    While yes  people have biases and preferences about the heights of the people they want to date  If you go in with a horrible attitude about it too it makes it   x harder for you as well   I once dated a man who was           cm  and he never once mentioned his height  He was honestly one of the funniest  most intelligent  most charismatic and most ambitious men that I have ever dated  He didn t let his height stop him from pursuing women 
Reddit,Dating in your   s when you don t want kids,It has to be one of the most dispiriting things in the dating scene  I feel like so many women must ve swiped left on me  although they may have had other reasons to be sure  but I like to think I have a nice - albeit niche - profile all things considered  that I m buried at the very bottom of the stack barrel   It s so much more noticeable than when I was in my   s - but then again  I wasn t using dating apps in my   s so that s not the most reliable comparison  But the kids issue wasn t coming up back then - now practically every profile I see is wanting kids  And because I don t want to waste either of our time  that s an instant swipe left no matter what else their profile is like - and I assume they do the same to me   But that must bury my chances of being seen even by those rare few I   am   compatible with     I ve - for the first time - deleted and reinstalled the apps  but it s immediately business as usual   Your experiences with this  I often give up but then I am sucked back in    Dating apps are great for making you feel unwanted or like nobody else is on your wavelength

Reddit,Is not wanting to meet up immediately a weird thing ,I ve had more than several instances of people suggesting a dinner date after exchanging a total of five messages between each other  I usually decline not because of the person specifically  but because I m in the boat of liking to chat in the messenger at least for a little bit  Get to know the basics and whether or not there s a good vibe there  For me I d rather not make the trek and pay for a night out on something I have practically zero feelings about yet  If we keep talking for a few days or weeks and we ve kept up a decent rapport  then I m down   The only thing is that it seems like people are pretty put off when I decline the date  I get that being turned down isn t a great feeling  but they seem bewildered why I would want to talk longer before actually meeting up  When they ask why I usually just say I d prefer to chat and get to know them more before going out  But honestly the conversation is usually dry after that   Everyone s got their own pace and needs when it comes to online dating  Back when I started years ago it seems like people were totally okay with just talking in the messenger for awhile and weren t jumping to dates so quickly  Is it just a signal that we re probably not looking for the same things  Or should I be a little more spontaneous and go on these quick dates    I forgot to add context but I m M looking to date other M 
Reddit,Do most women expect an immediate spark on the first date ,So since I    M  have switched to Hinge from Bumble in September I suddenly was in a position to be able to go on dates almost every weekend   In half of the cases although the dates were alright-ish but there was a mutual disinterest as either the girls didn t look like in the pictures or the conversation was just nothing special and didn t go anywhere so there was  mutual ghosting   In one case I declined because although she was very attractive and reached out to me after the date first  the date was quite boring as I was constantly checking the time as there were long moments of silence and awkwardness due to lack of mutual interests   In one case  I went on   dates  the first one was a coffee walk where we ended up chatting for almost   hours  Next one was at a crowded museum  her idea  where we wandered around for   hours  I wanted to continue with her but she said she didn t feel the romantic connection but wanted to stay as friends   In  -  other cases  the first dates were quite good with long chats so I asked them out again but at the end I got messages that they enjoyed talking to me but they didn t feel romantic connection   In those   cases I just accepted it as I found those girls interesting enough to meet again but didn t have any big hopes   Personally  I very rarely feel an immediate spark towards someone  in the past it appeared during second or third dates   Maybe saying that there s no romantic connection is just a different way to say that you are not their type or you are attractive enough     I am open to hear your thoughts

Reddit,In OLD culture  how can things evolve organically while still being intentional ,Ideally I want a relationship with the potential of marriage   Knowing that I m dating ideally to marry means I m taking my connections seriously  but not wanting to rush into something as I feel like I want to be sure of the next person I enter a relationship with   I d rather be alone than tied to the wrong person   With OLD  I feel like it s hard to have that organic evolving element the way you d experience an organic connection   Lately  I ve felt like I ve been conducting job interviews with the dates I ve been going on  which I kind of think is because I m meeting them all online   In the past I ve kind of rushed into relationships for the purpose of securing someone  something I ve worked through in therapy    There s one guy I ve been on   dates with and I want our connection to evolve naturally the way it would in the real world while still being semi intentional   We ve spoken about it and he agrees   I just wonder how I can let things evolve organically while being intentional   Has anyone successfully approached OLD this way   Like I know organically means not putting time constraints on anything  but intentional means you should   Just trying to figure out a good balance 
Reddit,If She Says  I Need To Get To Know You More First  -- I Would Move On,Personal opinion  and based on my experiences    If you have exchanged a decent amount of information  like  -  messages with a woman  and she refuses to meet up and gives you the  I need to get to know you more first  message  she just doesn t have that high of a level of interest   I ve tried to rationalize this in my head  thinking logically that maybe they just aren t comfortable meeting a stranger  but every woman I ve ever gone out with has made getting together in a public location incredibly easy in that many messages  They were excited when I proposed getting together  and everything felt effortless and easy to meet them   Women that are really interested  wouldn t want to potentially pass up on an opportunity with a man that they are really interested in and excited about  Women make it easy  and they help you when they like you   At the end of the day  even if you spend a week s  plus chatting  you both are still meeting with a stranger  and a person may be well composed over text  but you can never truly know a person well from text alone  Some red flags can come out over chat  but that s about it   The more you chat with her  the idea of going on a date becomes less mysterious  it becomes less interesting  and women love to gradually discover and wonder about you  They like when the dating experience unfolds like a story and they do not know everything about you upfront    Just some things I ve gathered after years of dating  There s a chance sometimes you can get these women out  but when they re less enthusiastic and excited about seeing you  the date will go worse because they aren t willing to put their best foot forward  Thats a lot less fun

Reddit,Do you or have you ever met up for sex without meeting in person first ,Maybe I m just paranoid but the amount of opportuniites I ve had over the last   -   years of having sex via meeting someone over an app is insane  All of which I chickened out on   All I can think about is   what if this is a setup    what if i get there and her bf is there and it s a scam to mug me   and shit like that  do people really just go fuck after matching on an app and idk  nothing bad happens lol 
Reddit, Don t expect this or that ,I have noticed in the previous few years of OLD when I match with a girl and I ask for her number or snapchat I get the  don t expect any dirty pictures  I am not like that  or when I ask about a date I get  don t expect sex  i am not a whore   So how do you guys handle when they say these things  To me it s more of a turn off or it has me lose interest more often than if they didn t say anything
Reddit,Is online dating harder for Black people in America   Please be brutally honest ,Ok  so I m not wondering this just because I don t get any match on Tinder     Rather  I m wondering this because of a few things Ive seen over the years going on and off of dating sight like Tinder  Bumble  Etc        Found a few accounts that openly say stuff like  If you re black  don t message me  or  No black guys   Even went on a date with a girl that openly say stuff like I normally don t date black men   Seen that alot in      -       Not sure if its still a thing because I haven t messed with dating sites in a while   Also  I know it s an minority of women that does this  but it just makes me wonder  Do a larger majority of women think this and the minority are just bold enough to say it       I can hardly find any black women on dating sites either  As in  the app will only show me White women for majority of the time and I have to basically dig to find any black women   I think you gotta pay to select a specific race  back in the day    but  I think they got rid of that feature   I heard a while ago that dating websites put the people with the most  checks  in front so they can be even more visible  So  I m guessing that s what happening for the most part      I heard that people tend to date within there race for the most part  Which I completely understand and I don t actually take that much offense to point   and   because of this fact  And I m guessing that White People are the majority in the US    If that s true then I guess it all makes sense in the end and I probably gotta adjust for it  Maybe find apps that work better for Black People or something    But ya  TL DR  Title here 
Reddit,Must offer Witty Banter ,This is on     of all female profiles yet when you actually text  call or get on video chat most women themselves can not offer witty banter  They just kinda sit there and hope you make them laugh or say something lightly insulting while forgetting the  banter  part of it that they re supposed to be witty   funny   charming as well  I wish that whole thing would go away    Banter is   way street--- not I do all the work

Reddit,Are guys serious when they say they do better on hinge than tinder  ,I m a guy and I do way better on tinder than I do on hinge   I match  and also meet  very attractive girls off tinder   I rarely match with attractive girls on hinge   Tinder is kinda pay to play   Like if I use platinum I can swipe on    girls and match with   of them  i swipe selectively and don t swipe a lot tbh    Free tinder is still ok   I don t swipe much just wait for likes to gather and then start swiping like once or twice a week   On hinge I usually only match with girls I m not really into lol  yes I ve used paid version    I use same pics on both apps   Also tinder girls are more laid back ime and less likely to ghost me after a first date hookup   One thing I like about hinge is it s easier to start a convo on thanks to all the prompts   Im just wondering   I see lots of guys say they don t do good on tinder but very well on hinge    Are y all paid by the company  
Reddit,Dating is confusing   ,I m very casual and relaxed I don t expect big dinners or fancy dates or whatever  but I haven t dated since the early     s  I ve hardly used online dating apps  and this ish is tough    What are the expectations now  Like for example I was talking with this guy that I matched with on hinge  and he said that he was looking for a long-term relationship and I said that I am too but I m not wanting to get instantly committed  So then we plan to meet and I was about to drive down there halfway to meet him and he cancels his plans and wants me to come meet him at a park and his hometown  I of course said no cuz umm small female in a dark wooded area  No    He quickly backtracked and he said he just wanted to make sure the vibes were right before we went out and I said that s not what it sounds like  and he said well I didn t want to spend money if things weren t going well  And eventually he said he d rather have a long term fuck buddy that s what he meant by long term relationship   Another guy expected me to pay for HIM  I said no  you asked me to this  it was a holiday party     bucks a person  I ll pay for my own but no  All the dudes want me to drive to them  I attract all the dudes who just want a hole  How do I weed them out and find someone who wants to date and see where it leads vs fwbs    Am I representing myself wrong 
Reddit,frustration ,hello all       x   B   at first on tinder   bumble   fb dating etc   I was getting tons of matches  some good conversations   and then all of a sudden no matches   is this cuz I have been shadow banned   I just don t understand  
Reddit,Matched and then unmatched,Kinda feel defeated and disappointed honestly  If they weren t interested in me then why swipe right at all  I might take a break or leave these apps all together because the majority of people using them feel incredibly fake honestly 
Reddit,Is there any way to meet women outside of dating apps ,I hate that it feels like I m forced to use the apps  For instance  today I saw this lady working at a store that I found attractive  But  I didn t ask anything beyond item questions out of fear of being creepy or her not feeling the same way back because you can never tell if a worker is being nice just cause they work there   But  this felt like the first normal woman I talked to in a while  Everyone I meet off the apps has   to   kids  baby daddy issues  or their obsessed with smoking and doing drugs  or their  in the process of a divorce   Especially  since covid I ve noticed a lot of the in the process of a divorce ladies  which is annoying because they re also quick to ghost the second things get better with their partner  The women on dating apps never seem to look that good either  I mean some of them look like crack addicts    So  I m like where are all the normal women at  You can t talk to women at work out of fear of losing your promotion  gossip  or your career  Because of American culture theirs no events to meet any women  The suburban lifestyle encourages you store spend hours in traffic and at work    The only things you can somewhat do to meet women are bars  But  what if you don t drink  Also  I feel like everyone there hangs out in groups of people they grew up with or already know  So  I feel like I would just end up standing there if I went there by myself  I also feel like it s a waste of money buying people drinks  paying cover charges  and driving there for women that could just be using me for free drinks then ghost me   Should I have asked the women her phone number at the store  or what other ways are their to meet women  Idk what to do anymore  The apps were good up to      or so  But  now idk if the women are even active on them  Even if you do match a lot of women end up being   or   states away  and I never seem to get matches in my area  Or they send a couple hey how you doing messages  then stop responding when I ask something deep like their hobbies or what they do for work 
Reddit,What s a random reason you got unmatched  Part          lol ,So someone else made a thread asking the same thing the other day and I commented but after today  I felt this deserved its own thread    Anyways  last night I received a like from a girl on hinge who liked one of my prompts that said  leave a comment if you like    And so I swiped right and matched with her  This morning I saw a prompt on her profile that said  I go crazy for stand up comedy   I message her asking  hey  who s your favorite stand up comedians   only to see that she unmatched me a few hours later  Gee  what was I thinking  lol  I mean maybe it was an accidental right swipe on her part but I just thought it was odd considering she initially liked my profile 
Reddit,Facebook dating not matching with people in Area ,When I first started using Facebook I got a wide range of matches from people fairly close and far way  Now it seems that I only match with black women who are   or   states away     hours away   Has anyone else had this happen  I ve dated some black women off the site I liked  It s just weird that I never match with anyone in my area or get shown to more ethnicities 
Reddit,Online Dating Feels like Gambling Now ,The apps are like a casino now  always trying to figure out how to get you to spend money on them    Oh  you have     likes  Get Tinder Gold now to see them   Spend the    bucks to see who is liking you  half of them are people who aren t within     miles of me  most of them are on different continents       of them are gay guys who set their gender to woman so they can see straight guys      are local women that I am not interested in  and maybe    are women I would be interested in  so I swipe right and send a message - no response      dollars wasted   The concept of swiping left right  liking disliking profiles  feels like a slot machine  Will you hit it big today  Nope  you did not  There s always tomorrow  Rinse and repeat   Maybe  the woman I have been messaging back and forth with will actually be down to go on a date  instead of just be pen pals for weeks until we inevitably fall out of contact  Maybe she could be a potential girlfriend  or maybe she will get blackout drunk on the date and try to force herself on me  and get mad I don t let her suck me off  especially since she paid for my drinks  this actually happened to me  she refused to let me pay  and got angry I didn t have sex with her while she was blackout   Maybe  we will have sex  and maybe it will good  or maybe she will give me Chlamydia   Lots of insane risk with not much guaranteed reward  just like if I put      in Blackjack   And at the end of it all  I tell myself maybe the next time will be different  and I come back  again  and again  and again  It never changes  and it never really gets better  Does anyone else feel like this  I ve deleted Tinder and Bumble and Facebook Dating  all I have now is Hinge    x   B 
Reddit,Creative and tactful ways to compliment a woman s physical appearance ,Despite conventional wisdom forbidding compliments on innate physical characteristics I think physical compliments when used tactfully can really help to put a woman s mind at ease especially if you ve met on a dating app where looks can be deceiving even if unintentional  and they can also help to inject some sexuality into the interaction   But guys what approach has yielded the best feedback for you and ladies what approach would you like for guys to take   Does it differ on dating apps versus a vis a vis date 
Reddit,Why does ghosting hurt so much,Just venting -   I started dating a guy in September  so for a little over   months   and we were seeing each other and talking to each other very regularly  Then  the month of November we didn t see each other at all due to him taking a long vacation  work schedule  him getting sick and the Thanksgiving holiday  We saw each other at the beginning of the week but things just felt a little different  but I kinda assumed it was because we hadn t seen each other in a month  Then we weren t talking at all  but we did say we would see each other this weekend  I sent him a message last night asking if he wanted to go do something  He didn t respond  so my last message to him said something to the fact that I d like to talk about what s going on  but if he didn t want to date anymore  I hope he would feel comfortable enough to tell me  I ve kind of accepted the fact that we re over  and I m not really expecting a text back anymore  but why does ghosting hurt so much more than if he were to tell me that he s not interested in dating anymore  I m feeling a bit sad because three months felt long enough that he could have at least communicated that things were ending

Reddit,I m losing my drive to participate in the OLD world,I had recently been talking to a woman that I was pretty into  but was just hit with the  I m not feeling the connection I m looking for  line which was pretty deflating for me  We d been on   or so dates and I was putting in a fair amount of effort to keep them fun and unique  We had a lot in common and conversation flowed really well  imo  and I was making it clear that I was interested  We hadn t had any sort of exclusivity DTR conversation and the most that things had progressed physically was some heavy making out  but I m still bummed - mostly because I saw potential with her but also because this puts me back on the dating hamster wheel         I m a    year old guy that keeps himself in shape  is both intellectually curious and driven  and has a great career  I m not  head-turning  attractive but I m above average I d say  So while objectively it seems like I shouldn t be struggling so much  the semi consistent rejection of OLD  with this most recent situation as an acute example  has exhausted me a lot         I m curious as to what others have done to avoid this sort of negative feeling  I work from home and the apps have been my main way to meet people in recent years  but I m wondering if I need to approach dating from a completely different angle 
Reddit, the bar is so low  seems to be a common thing here    so then who are you dating ,I often here women on this sub  among other dating subs say that  the dating bar is  so low  for them now  If that is the case then  what exactly is  low   and how are you having trouble finding a man    Asking because if it really is that low then  I d imagine women shouldn t be having issues finding a relationship   The  bar  isn t that low if any woman is having issues finding a relationship lol  I have a pretty damn high bar and I do ok but if I had a  low bar   i d have  date every day of the week  As a man  Something isn t adding up
Reddit,Facebook Dating App is Scary,I m not being too serious  but I am  I recently got on the app as I m dating online  I ve been online dating for almost a year now  I really like Hinge  it has a pretty good layout and it s also not too overwhelming as far as  likes  or  matches  go  I was on Bumble  I think it was a pretty cool app and I was on Tinder as well    I love that Facebook doesn t make you pay for certain accesses  However  the likes get soooo overwhelming  I logged out the app for a couple of hours ofc  and got back on it and I checked who likes me  I was pressing  X  for sooo long    It was such a long list of people who liked me that It actually creeped me out to the point that I straight deleted my account lmao    I don t know how I was supposed to filter through all those people  And I m not trying to brag or anything  I was genuinely creeped tf out      Anyways   What are you guys favorite dating apps

Reddit,How much time do you spend daily on Tinder and other dating apps ,How much time do you spend daily on Tinder and other dating apps  Men specifically cause I know women spend considerably less time   For me it s like up to   hours in total if I have to swipe on   apps  free versions  which I find a huge waste of time 
Reddit,I started a dating journal    years ago  it s interesting to see how dating and sex has changed,Ten years ago I got out of my last long term relationship and I started a dating journal  I was    at the time and have since kept track of every date I ve been on  Today I went back and read through most of it and found it fascinating  I m sure some of the changes were from my personality and preferences evolving over the years as I got older  but some are definitely major cultural changes   Anecdotal trends I noticed  Openly dating is much more open  It s common for men to openly talk about the other women they are seeing now  This NEVER happened ten years ago  it seems like it really changed after COVID   Dating apps seems to be the exclusive way to meet people now  Rarely does someone just come up and talk to me when I m out  I also don t usually talk to a stranger when I m out myself  so I m part of the problem   First dates are WAY more casual  personally I think it s a good change  Most are just a drink or a coffee  I haven t had a first date at a movie or full dinner since        I split all bills on dates now  Probably comes from a more stable financial situation being further in a career  but it seems like it s just understood that it s going to be split   Guys apparently HATE wearing condoms now  Everytime I bring it up they act like I m from the dark ages   Oh  I haven t used a condom in years  is a common response  In almost all encounters when I started the journal it wasn t even a conversation  guys just put one on when it progressed to the point where we were having sex   In their defense  almost every guy now has a recent STD test result on their phone and gladly shows it off   To go along with this  If not specifically discussed  guy s not wearing a condom just don t pull out  In     -     that happened   times  No discussion was default to pull out      -           of the time if not discussed they did NOT pull out   Grooming seems to have fallen away  Lot s of unkempt bushes  not a good trend   Ghosting is super common now  Since           of guys I actually met for a date completely ghosted at one point with no reason given   Rimjobs went from pretty far on the taboo side of things to everyone under    doing it without even discussing  To the point where in       the first time I received one  I noted that it happened after a long discussion  In a recent      entry it was barely noted as part of casual foreplay   Seems like an obvious thing but since      politics have become a serious deal breaker for the guys I ve met   In general the fitness level of guys has decreased a TON  Probably part of dating older people more than a cultural change   Dating sex in general is WAY more casual   Stats  Gone on dates with     different individuals          first met in person  none since                matched on Tinder Bumble Hinge        met on Reddit        introduced by a friend coworker     sexual partners  Oldest date was     this year  I was      Youngest date was     It was when I was      I m a white female I split time between urban Midwest and parts of the rural PNW  so demographically dates are all over the place   Anyway  I thought it was very interesting to see how dating sex has changed in my life over    years as different technologies come and go 
Reddit,what do you guys think happened  is she lying ,i have been talking to a girl on hinge for a few weeks  we made plans to get together tonight a week ago but never specified a time  she stopped answering my messages on tuesday night  and was giving short answers with me asking all the questions  so i took that as she wasn t really interested so i never bothered to ask what time  she then messages me  hi  this morning and i asked if she still wanted to get together  she responded with wanting to reschedule b c she got into a car accident last night  i said that s fine and asked what happened  and if she was ok obviously  and she said she didnt want to talk about it this whole thing seems a little strange no  or am i overthinking it

Reddit,Ghosting,Just curious on how often everyone gets ghosted    Went out on a date a few nights ago and we were texting all the time up to the date  She said I was attractive  great personality  checked all the boxes  We went on the date  She said I looked better in person  we got through like an hour on the date and she said she wanted to go back to her place  She said I was a great kisser  Good in bed  Next day  ghosted  Haven t heard a thing    Same thing happened about a month ago with another woman  She was all over me from the second we met  Ended up going back to her place  I spent the night  never heard from her again     This doesn t happen with every date  There   other women I m seeing at the moment but man  it certainly messes with your head

Reddit,How long were you on the apps till you matched with someone you genuinely liked ,I have only been seriously online dating since mid-September  and I don t even know if I would call it serious because I don t exactly know what I want  I mostly want an ongoing casual situation with a decent and respectful guy  but I m open to something a bit more serious if it appears  I ve talked to a lot of guys - too many guys within this short amount of time tbh  I know that my numbers are too high  but at the same time  I m talking to a lot of men who don t take much initiative or make too much effort when trying to talk to me  so I just move on  On the other hand  I m meeting guys that are needy as hell  One guy called and texted me every day for a week after I had already stopped responding to his messages  Another guy questioned why I didn t respond to his text the same night  and we had been talking for two days   I started talking to one guy  and thought I was actually starting to like him because he was being sweet but then he started being a jerk and breadcrumbing me  so I stopped liking him  I ve gone on a few dates  been asked out on more  Of all these men  I don t know if I ve actually liked any of them in a real way because  again  nice guy turned into a jerk pretty quickly   I m slowing down the process and only talking to a few guys at a time  but I feel no deep interest or spark  I m not worried  per se  because this has been my reality many times when dating in real life  and it s only been     months  But I am curious how long it took others to at least genuinely like someone  even if it didn t go anywhere      x   B

Reddit,To message or not to message ,I get hung up on this quite frequently with online dating  You go on a date with someone you both say you had a good time and send your I got home safe have a goodnight message and then nothing  Or you video chat  it goes well and they say they ll give you a call tomorrow if that s ok with you and you say yes and they told follow through or text    I always question if I should message then especially if I was the last person to send a message or if they said they call and they don t  It s not like they is a long standing relationship  It s just one date or a few texts exchanges for a few days and a video chat  I ve always been told and had thought process that if they are interested in you they will make the effort and call when they say they will call or text  What is the best approach  Sometimes I want to just message them and say are you interested in continuing to get to know each other and another part of me is saying get the message they didn t call or text because they are not interested anymore

Reddit,A guy unmatched me after I said my favorite band was Pink Floyd,I ll never know if that s the exact reason  but funny to think once you have a little back story    On Hinge  he liked one of my pictures  I thought he was cute but a little voice told me he kind of had  crazy eyes   they were striking but seemed a little Clockwork Orange-esque   I noticed on his profile as well he had the prompt  You shouldn t go out with me if  and the answer  if music  scares  you    I was curious and matched with him and we exchanged pleasantries  how s your day going  what did you do this weekend    After his response  I asked him what he meant by music  scaring  people and what kind of music he liked   He told me he listens to everything except country and dubstep  and that his favorite genera s were deathcore  heavy metal  and death metal  He said that usually when he tells people this  they ghost him immediately  and then asked what I liked   I told him that I wasn t into country and the only dubstep I listened to was when a band I liked tried their hand at it  I said it seemed a bit silly to ghost someone because of their music preference and that deathcore  heavy metal and the like don t bother me as my brother is into those genres   I finished my reply by saying my favorite band was Pink Floyd    I woke up the next morning and checked the app to see if he responded and was met with the  no new matches  page of Hinge    I wasn t upset  just was confused and thought it d be pretty hypocritical if he actually unmatched me because music preference lol  I d like to think maybe he matched with someone else and really hit it off  but guess we ll never know  
Reddit,Are you opposed to liking someone that you know in real life ,I ve been using datings apps for over   years at this point and can t even begin to tell you how many people I ve seen on there that I know in real life  Some of these people are former classmates of mine while others are friends of friends  some of whom I ve never personally met but know of   Anyways  my question is if there s a stigma against liking someone you know in real life on a dating app  Reason I ask is because every single one of these people that I ve liked have never reciprocated interest or liked me back  I want to clarify that I m not saying they have to as it s perfectly fine if they re not interested but I just find it odd that no one wants to give it a shot  For me  I d prefer going on a date with someone that I know in real life as opposed to a random person off of a dating app  Even if I m not super interested in the person I d be willing to give it a shot  especially if they live nearby  I don t know if that s just me or not but like I said it seems like if you know someone on a dating app then it s almost an instant no  at least in my experience

Reddit,Boys and Girls  how many do you date at once  And what do you say when your dates ask about your other dates ,I m in my   s F  recently joined Hinge and Tinder       likes in   days  bit overwhelming but ok   New to the dating scene     I ve had a few dates  didn t feel an initial spark for   but willing to give a second chance  date  Only been on first dates so far and want to carry on to see where it goes  Also planning on going another first date   I m looking for something serious but don t want to focus on just one person while going on dates until we re exclusive  seems fair that way     So when your dates ask you about your other dates what do you say  Or do you not talk about it  I feel a bit awkward about it  I m approaching second dates I m sure it ll come up but the same time don t want to put them off or feel bad for giving too much information  How do you approach this conversation   Edit   I m in my late   s
Reddit,Guys  when a woman delays text responses  are you more  or less interested in her for a LTR ,Please start your response with  More  or  Less  and explain  but be honest and don t talk about what you prefer  but how it affected your interest  Many people still think less availability and predictability is a sure fire way to increase interest   For me  it does make me think about the person more and possibly  chase   in the short-term  but it erodes my trust in a potential long term relationship  because it makes me feel that they are either manipulating me  or looking to play the field and it hurts that individual s standing with me as a potential long-term partner   I am always going to cut the unreliable texter loose if I had to choose  over the woman who texts me back within a few hours  all other things being equal   Curious to hear other perspectives 
Reddit,Mostly getting likes from transsexuals,Basically the title  I ve been on several dating platforms and this holds on all of them  Does that mean I look gay or too feminine or is it the case for most people on the dating apps  Sometimes those crossdressers and transsexuals would be the only likes  Also  out of curiousity  once I decided to change my settings on Tinder to show men temporarily  and my likes exploded instantly  Unfortunately  I am straight and have no interest in those people  Does someone else have a similar experience 
Reddit,Too good to be true ,M      and F       We matched around a week ago on popular dating app and conversation started out strong  Some steamy messages were exchanged and everything is looking good  We decided to quickly meet publicly two days ago  to see if the vibe was right and get to know each other better over a coffee  Yesterday she came over to my place and one thing lead to another  Innuendo  and we finished the night in each other s arms with some sweet conversation    She is gorgeous and      my type  She values traditional gender roles  is fit and very supportive and sweet  Almost too sweet and supportive  I simply can t get my mind off of her  Part of me didn t think women like her even existed  She does appear to have daddy issues  but I don t know enough about her yet to jump to this conclusion    Throughout all of this one week  I have had the feeling that this has been too good to be true  like there is some ulterior motive in her mind for why she is treating me so nicely  and well  Am I overthinking my opportunity with a genuine  unicorn  or is there something else going on that I am not seeing  Not intended to be a boast or brag  I truly just don t know what the hell I did to deserve this opportunity  She is still very interested in continuing to meet up with me and shows enthusiasm in every message we exchange  Has anyone experienced something like this    TLDR  I  M     hooked up with a       F     after a week of casual chatting  her sending me nudes and she is willing to travel   -   minutes just to see me   
Reddit,My kids come first , I m a straight male so I can only speak to what I see on females  profiles  But at     lead with or have  My kids come first and will always come first   Somewhere in their bio    It s not that I disagree with the sentiment  to me it s just pretty obvious  they are your kids I don t expect to come before them  Is this really a problem for women  I almost want to troll them and say  I expect to come before your kids   Haha I view this as an unnecessarily confrontational statement and pretty cringy  I swipe left instantly   What are your opinions  does anyone else see this as a turn off  I m open to enlightenment 
Reddit,Recently learned I am     ,Went a date over the weekend with a guy who claimed to be       Before meeting him  I thought how great it was that he was being honest and not rounding up to     to get more matches  He got to the restaurant before I did  and was already seated  We sit and talk and eat for a bit  and all seems to be going well so we decide to go walk around a bit  and that s when I realize I must be      because we re almost the exact same height  How funny that when I measured myself two months ago I was only       For real though  I don t care about height  and I was previously married to a guy who was a tiny bit shorter than myself  I do care that the guy I went on a date lied about his height by making himself a good  -  inches taller  We weren t a good fit for other reasons as well  but how he thought I wouldn t notice is beyond me 
Reddit,Would you date someone you ve dated in the past who ended things with you because they were seeing someone else ,We all know people date other people  it s the way of the world  People like to keep their options open  and sometime you re not someone s first choice  or even their second or third    If you were dating someone and they ended things with you because they felt more serious about someone else  and then it didn t work out and that person wanted to date you again would you agree  Rationally I believe it shouldn t matter so long as things ended on good terms  but humans aren t fundamentally rational  We hold grudges and have a lot of misplaced pride   What would you choose

Reddit,What s up with guys that use this particular line ,The line I m referring to is something alone the lines of  it s hard to believe a woman as beautiful as you is single on these apps has a hard time finding dates offline    It s a bit wild when you re not the model or influencer type in a conventional sense   Like  I assume we all are going for someone within our threshold or our cup of tea  so like did these guys come on these apps expecting to settle for a woman they re not attracted to   Do they have low self esteem that they assume every woman they find attractive is someone is above their league or someone they have to compete with other men for  even if she s normal   Is this maybe early lovebombing     Guys  give us some insights on your reasons  esp if you say this to girls who aren t model or influencer tier   Girls  if you ve been messaged and even met up with someone who said this  please share your insights and experiences in what such guys were like too 
Reddit,Meeting up with people who instantly block or ghost me ,I don t think I m a catfish  Especially because some of the people I ve met up with were from Bumble BFF and were just friendship meet ups     But so far  -  people have unmatched and unblocked me  Is this normal  I don t have any crazy wild opinions and if I did I d never share them on a first meeting  I m not overtly sexual or even mention sex  I shower and wear the same type of clothing in my pics   My best friend thinks I m doing something wrong  I live in LA if that makes a difference  People are pretty shifty out here   I know without being there with me you wouldn t know but I d still like to ask if this is normal 
Reddit,Have you come across any famous people on dating apps ,Over the past year using Hinge  I ve come across more than a handful of famous semi-famous people  I ve come across a professional lacrosse player  three olympians  the daughter of a famous MLB manager  and today I came across this girl who was on the bachelor twice  It s strange because in my first year using the app I didn t come across anyone who claimed to be famous but for whatever reasons over the past  -   months  I ve come across a lot of people  Just curious if anyone else has experienced this using dating apps   Edit  After reading some of these I remembered that I ve also come across a few news anchors  I came across a couple of people who worked at an MLB stadium as a part of the entertainment crew in between innings  Also  saw this one girl recently who ended up on some blind fold gaming show that s all over social media  I m sure there might be some others too but those are the ones I remember off the top of my head at the moment

Reddit,Is NOT having a social media presence a deal breaker ,In a Facebook group  someone asked if someone s social media content could be a deal breaker  and one woman that popped out at me was the fact that if he DID NOT have social media  she d label him as sketchy and or suspicious  And possibly a deal breaker   I found this odd considering her age bracket  her   s  Of course  she could be biased as she was a content creator  podcaster    I thought it to be a bit too judgy on her part though   I responded to her as I thought it may be more attractive  and I would be like  Good for you  maybe a lot of us should walk away from social media  I actually would envy them a bit  
Reddit,Best website for actually getting to know someone and not just if you find them attractive ,Online dating seems a lot different from      when I last used it    I really liked how OkCupid worked where you answered a ton of questions and based on your questions were matched up with others and had things to talk about    I wouldn t mind something where people have a bunch of blurbs about them  Kinda like bumble  but better   Does anything like this exist  Or is everything a  Would I fuck them   swipe fest 
Reddit,What s the best dating app for someone not looking for a hookup , 
Reddit,How many of you date outside of your city ,I ve always had my limits to a    mile radius  I always thought it was dumb when people fall in love with someone online that isn t near them  especially in another country  But I m tempted to expand my profile to global dating just so I can see new faces   I m over this city  Plus you never know your match may not be near you and if things work out then one of you can move closer if things get serious  Who s to say your perfect match is in your town  Maybe it s time to look further  I m ready for my Lizzie McGuire movie Cheetah Girls   moment 
Reddit,What is a red flag for you  that others might think is silly ,I m a   f for reference  For me  it s the following   A guy who uses too many laughing emojis when chatting  specifically these      Something about it comes off as so belittling  Or if they use an exclamation after every sentence  It feels a little too eager    If they start the convo with a physical appearance compliment  Like  hey gorgeous  or  you re hot  we should get drinks   It could be my own insecurities  but it feels like they didn t read anything in my profile and only value looks  It also makes me insecure that they ll lose interest as I age  I do like these type of compliments once it s with someone I feel comfortable with    What are yours   EDIT  I like emojis and use them too  It s the overuse and used in a specific style that feels belittling  Here is an example below    So do you always wear black in all your photos        My thanksgiving was crazy  Do you cook        This app sucks    Wanna get drinks     
Reddit,Catfish fake profile ,would u suspect a fake dating profile if they did a bunch of insta hashtags unironically as their photo description despite being in their    s  I just cant see the point since theyre not links  which makes me think they stole both the pics and descriptions
Reddit,Would it manipulative to use ai generated photos of yourself on dating sites , Like some people don t get photographed a lot and its kinda of difficult a lot of the time to take decent pics of your because it harder to objectively judge your own appearance in the same way you can with other people or view the way other how other people can with you    Shouldn t it be okay to generate pics of that are flattering  as long as they show what you really look like and don t deceptively change or showcase your body type  wealth  or lifestyle

Reddit,Why do men insult you on dating apps for no reason ,Seriously  Just ignore or unmatch if you don t  like someone  On these apps I ve been told I m     absolutely stupid  for only wanting to meet someone who is also looking for a relationship   A  weirdo     for not sharing additional photos of myself  I used the maximum amount and my profile is verified   And just now  a guy I hadn t matched with or interacted with in any way sent a sarcastic intro on what I thought was a nice photo of me in a dress saying  well done   you are contributing so much to the world    Like  why  Why is it ok to make people like shit for no reason  Maybe I m being too sensitive  But if I apply for a job  or talk to people on Reddit  or whatever  I expect to be treated with the bare minimum of respect that I show to everyone else  Why should dating apps be any different   It kills me because I do want to find a guy  but it makes me so anxious that you never know who is about to make you feel awful about yourself  Urgh    Edit  thanks for so many lovely comments  
Reddit,Do people like then guys first message too you is asking to meet right away ,I receive numerous messages from guys asking to meet up in the first message  However  I never agree because I don t know them  I prefer getting to know someone over text for a day or two before considering a date   But what about you guys  Do you go out right away if they ask 
Reddit,Facebook Dating  I can t view who liked me,I don t know if anyone else has this issue  maybe it s because I have a new phone but Facebook dating is more broke than the average American nowadays  I can t view who liked me  maybe once a day it ll actually show people  I ll go through my likes and right before I can swipe left or right on the next person BOOM black loading screen that never loads  Has anyone else had this issue

Reddit,Every girl i vibe with doesn t text back after few days  ,I m mainly using Hinge for dating at this point i like a girl status and comment my thoughts on her and she replay back and we hit it off with none stop texting  that applies to all my matches for these past few weeks     Most of them instantly rule out the fact we should meet after sending say like    messages and i happily agree   After few more text she just kinda slow her texts a bit and never replay back     I have always been honest to everyone   i have no idea what i m doing wrong here   Any advice would be greatly appreciate it
Reddit,What are the best apps websites to meet alt guys   Guys in the alternative scene ,I wanna meet people like me 
Reddit,Not convinced after the first date  shall I give another try ,I    M  went on a date today with a girl    F  I met on Hinge  I matched with her back in September and messaged quite often for the first few days  Then it was a couple of messages back and forth quite irregularly  The reason behind this was the fact that she lives an hour and a half from the city where I live  London  and that she s a doctor in a hospital so often works during weekends  In the meantime  she also went to her home country in SE Asia for a month   I agreed to meet her even though I wasn t particularly enthusiastic after chatting online for so long  in general I prefer to meet within the first   weeks or month at the latest if there are right reasons  but had a free afternoon so met up with her anyway  We went on a walk hike and then to a restaurant  She was really pretty  feminine and very kind but the conversation didn t really flow  could be due to her English skills which are not at very proficient level  I m also an immigrant  and cultural differences  as we don t have a lot in common    Based on the conversation I ve noticed that we don t have any similar hobbies or interests - I m not very sporty but I like to go on hikes  go for a run go to gym  once or twice a week or play squash  She doesn t do any sports or physical activities  When I proposed the first  date at a museum or art gallery  I like going to such places  she declined  She doesn t do any of the things that I do like going to concerts  cinema or theatres or reading books  When asked what she does in spare time she said sleeping  watching Netflix and going to restaurants   Despite lack of flow and some long moments of silence she enjoyed the date and messaged me about it  I responded by saying that it was nice to meet her and wished her a good week ahead  After the first date  I have mixed feelings because she s a really pretty girl but the personalities don t vibe at all so I don t see how we can form a more serious relationship  I could see she considered me attractive  she said I look younger than in the pics and I could see that she liked looking at me  but physical attraction is only something that is sufficient for the FWB type situationship  she seems to want something more serious so this is out of question I think  but even in such a case there must be at least a minimal common vibe   Shall I just politely let her know that I m not interested or give it another try and meet again 
Reddit,Facebook Dating - Help ,I cannot get access to Facebook Dating  and at this point it s just annoying  I m a serial non-serious dater  on all the apps  and I just think it would be intriguing to see who is on Facebook    I ve tried every troubleshoot  I m in a country that allows it  I have friends on the same street who have it   All updated  no restrictions or settings  It just doesn t appear to me at all     Why would I not have access 
Reddit,Risks of having someone else swipe on my behalf ,I ve been on Hinge and Tinder for   months and am getting tired of sifting through profiles  so I m considering hiring someone to swipe on my behalf  I have paid versions of both apps  so whoever I hire could set their location to mine  I am just worried that having two devices  at different locations  possibly across the globe   using my account at the same time  might flag my account and get me in trouble  Does anyone know the risks involved with doing this    
Reddit,Ok guys so give me the secret how should I approach you on dating apps ,I need help to pull in the audience  I never know what to say or how to make myself look interesting to start the conversation  I know most people don t like when you just say hey  I try to stay away from that but I also don t see what s wrong with it either  But obviously I need to do more  Most of the time I get ghosted even when it feels things are going well  I have tried flirting and complimenting to see if that works better 
Reddit,Is dating simply a mating dance ,I feel like it s this dance where   Start off showing your witt  build comfort and connect  steer things sexually  have sex a couple of times  then boom relationship   Like the dance steps are the same each time roughly   Am I right or wrong 
Reddit,How long is too long to wait for a response ,So  I m very new to the whole online dating game and I m wondering how long is too long to wait for a response from someone  I    F  recently joined Facebook Dating last month  I took a break for a few days and got back on this past Wednesday and matched with a guy who I m actually really interested in based on his profile  So far  his responses has been really slow but he at least apologized and said he was traveling for the holidays  Its now been   days since I ve heard a response  I was trying to be understanding since it is Thanksgiving weekend  but who doesn t have their phone on them  Is   days too long where i just move on  Or is this normal online dating response time 
Reddit,Niche Dating Apps,So  I had downloaded TurnUp  which matches based on music preferences  The interface is awesome  but the user base is obviously nowhere near something like a Bumble  Tinder  or Hinge  It got me wondering what other niche dating apps are out there that you ve had good experiences with  Obviously they will tend to have smaller user bases  but for those of us looking for monogamous LTRs  it only takes one 
Reddit,Wondering if people get the wrong idea about me being a gamer ,What to people typically think if someone mentions that they re a gamer somewhere in their profile    I wanted to be upfront with my hobbies  and I thought nothing of it at first  but I m starting to wonder if people get the wrong idea  I could be wrong  but I feel like there are a lot of people who hear  gamer  and picture a cliche dude-bro who s always yelling at the tv playing online shooters  But I like chill rpgs and story based games   Part of me wants to clarify the type of gamer I am  but I don t wanna sound like  I play games  but I m not like one of THOSE gamers   Or maybe I just overthinking this whole thing

Reddit,How important is the inclusion of a full body pic when liking a profile on hinge ,I made a hinge profile a few days ago and it s not going as well as I hoped  first day I got a lot of likes but it has petered out since then  I think my profile is fun  but I m aware that I don t have any pictures that include my body  I have selfies from my chest up so you can see that I am thin but I m not sure if that s enough  I am pretty camera shy so I avoid people taking pictures of me which has meant I don t have a great range to select from  also me and my friends are not really big social media users so are not the type to take photos of each other when out  How drastically do you think a full body pic will help my profile   Also would a mirror selfie be suffice or should I get someone to take a photo of me  Help    
Reddit,Am I a  catfish  if I don t include a picture of myself smiling while showing my teeth ,For context  I    M  have a lot of gaps between my teeth  Only the gap between the front two are visible every time I open my mouth  but a full ear-to-ear grin might show more gaps  I hadn t even realized none of my profile pictures included a full teeth-showing smile until someone I matched with commented on it while we were FaceTiming  She said she thought it was  charming  and was surprised to hear that I didn t like it  and almost expressed incredulousness at the notion that straight teeth would be considered better looking  Truth be told  I think pictures of me that don t show my teeth are more flattering for me than ones that do  and I struggle smiling in pictures in a way that looks authentic and not forced or awkward  But I only ask because I understand that some people might not want to date someone with gaps in their teeth  and not disclosing that may come off as deceitful or like I m trying to hide something about myself  which I m not to be sure   Would you feel deceived if you found out about someone s teeth gaps upon meeting them in person after having matched with them for a while  Am I overthinking this  Are teeth even that big of a deal   Update  I appreciate all of the feedback I ve received  I was able to find a picture of me smiling with teeth that looks both flattering and natural  so I included that in my profile  To be sure  I don t have  crackhead teeth   and I do take care of my oral health  My teeth are crooked and spaced  but not unhealthy  That said  it makes sense to me that although I had no dishonest intent in my profile as it was previously  some people might feel deceived in learning well after matching that I have gaps in my teeth  and it makes more sense to weed those people out ahead of time  
Reddit,What are you looking for ,I ask guys this and I m not sure if I should or not  but it s really not that big of a deal  If someone asks this question I think it means they want to communicate that we are on the same page and not waste each others time  The problem seems that  the guys that I ask  are immature and probably don t know what they are looking for and just want to mess around and see what they get  Or they don t like being asked because it s too forward  hence they are too immature to answer this question  Either way  its just a question  if you say serious or long term  I personally am not going to assume that its going to work out  it s simply to determine if I m wasting my time or not    I feel like these apps are just becoming a waste of time altogether  because no one is equally serious and has good communication skills  I also feel like both genders jump to conclusions way too fast over the smallest inconveniences 
Reddit,Break up first thing Thanksgiving morning  Should go go back on the apps ,Hi everyone  without going into too much details  I am now single again  Short   month relationship  but it still hurts  but I know myself and the longer I am single  the more I romanticize and grieve the relationship  While I m not going to just immediately download tinder bumble hinge  I am thinking about my future love life     When should I download the apps  I know you re supposed to get a boost when you redownload sign up again  But I also know online dating is a crapshoot and numbers game  Holiday seasons is statistically the worst time to find someone  so I was thinking that I don t want to waste my newbie boost    I m short       and I m currently in the process of dropping some weight  calorie deficit  work out plan and I m on track to lose   lbs by the new year    So I know I m not the ideal preference for many women online   TLDR  recently single  best to try online dating again or wait for a better time 
Reddit,A ton of matches but no messages ,I m a bit new to tinder  I recently started online dating on tinder  I waited about   years to start thinking about dating since my husband passed  I m not young but I m definitely not old  I m really not sure if this is normal as most of my friends are in relationships and haven t dated in a very long time  I ve messaged guys but no response  Is it normal to just  like  people and not message  Is this like a form of fishing  So many questions 
Reddit,Why do some people message you  Hiii   and then when you reply back  they never respond ,This has happened to me few times while using dating apps  Someone just comes out of blue and says hi  and then simply never responds when you reply back  I was not the first one to message you in fact  I didn t even checked your profile  I understand some people may lose their interest after checking your profile  but then  why do you send a message to initiate a conversation  This is stupid 
Reddit,PSA  DO NOT INSTALL HUD,I ll keep this short and simple  HUD  Hook Up Dating  app is a scam  Downloaded it and decided to give it a go  all went well until I decided to sign up for a week of premium    As soon   as I had paid for that app  it all went to shit    The app itself requires you to have   photos of yourself to see others photos  Once I paid for it  every single photo I tried to put up for my third photo was removed instantly  Didn t matter if it was me  my dog  or the damn neighbor  instantly removed  When I contacted the support they basically said sucks to suck and all payments are final  The best advice they had was to try restarting the app or logging out and back in  both of which were unsurprisingly failures   Long story short   If you end up lonely on a business trip like I did  do yourself a favor and download literally anything other than HUD  It s a giant money grab and nothing more 
Reddit,I    F am dating a   M I met online dating  Still Don t Know Each Other s Last Names - or how he feels at all , I m a   -year-old woman  and I ve been dating a   -year-old man for a little while now  We ve had six dates over the course of     months  and I m seeking some advice on our current dynamics   He s the one who initiates plans  usually once a week or every other week  Our dates have mostly been dinner outings  with the most recent one being him making us dinner at his apartment  which led to us having sex for the first time   I texted him after our past couple dates to express that I had a great time and thank him  and he reciprocates by keeping the conversation going throughout the week  His response time to texts can be up to    hours  however  which is something that bothers me   In terms of making plans  he often waits until a day or two before to set our next date  which leaves me in a bit of uncertainty   For example  on a Thursday he might text me to see what I m up to on Saturday   We still haven t spent a full day together  our dates have exclusively been   hours at the most  dinner dates at restaurants or him cooking at his apartment   I understand that he has a demanding job as a healthcare provider  which might contribute to his busy schedule and the timing of his texts  During our dates  we have engaging conversations about various topics like current affairs and work stories  but I ve noticed he doesn t ask many personal questions  As a result  there are still many things we don t know about each other  For instance  he doesn t even know my last name since Hinge only lists first names  and we haven t discussed our relationship histories or what we re looking for in a relationship  be it casual  long-term  etc    After   dates  he still hasn t said anything like  I like you   only that he had a good time with me   I m feeling a bit confused and would appreciate any  perspectives on how to navigate this situation  Should I be concerned about the lack of personal depth in our conversations   Is his texting pattern and planning behavior indicative of his interest level or simply a result of his busy job  I do want more clarity but I don t want to scare him away  since it s only   dates in   TL DR  I m     F  dating a    M  healthcare provider  After   dates  including dinner at his place leading to sex  I m unsure about our relationship dynamics  He s slow to plan dates and respond to texts  possibly due to his job  Our conversations lack personal depth  he hasn t asked about my past or what I want in a relationship  and hasn t expressed strong feelings  Seeking advice on whether these are red flags or normal  and how to approach defining our relationship without overwhelming him 
Reddit,Is there a dating site that allows you to sort short haired girls only ,I love short haired girls and the shorter the better  It s not like a fetish or anything weird like that   I think it s really pretty  I love long haired girls too  but I d love to go on a dating site where I could sort by that look because I often find out that girls with cute pixies are harder to find on most larger sites 
Reddit,Girl is confusing me,I ve been talking to this girl from tinder for the last couple of months  At first she told me she has never had a boyfriend and doesn t know if she d like that so was maybe more interested in just a hookup  So I went to hers just for a hookup but we ended up talking for hours and getting along very well  Then I asked if she wanted to go on an actual date and she said yes  The date went well and then we had another date which also went really well    After the second date I felt like things could go somewhere with her and she seemed to think the same  However  for the next few weeks we were both too busy to meet and I started to feel like she was losing interest  This is because she stopped making conversations over text and was a little blunt back to me  We eventually met again but the whole time she hardly made any physical contact with me and didn t make much conversation  mostly just on her phone     I told her that I was starting to feel like she was losing interest or not putting effort in and asked if there was any reason but she just said she had been tired and busy  She then went on to say that over Christmas she will be busier so if it s a problem now maybe we should end things   Do you think she just lost interest or had no interest in the first place and only wanted sex  We haven t messaged for two days and I m not sure if I should say anything to her 
Reddit,I m annoyed by people who only show their face partially,I get replies about guys wanting to swap pics but then what I get back is them sending me a pic of them wearing shades or a closeup of their eye    I know some people are scared since deepfakes or people stealing your photos can be a thing  Or someone screen shotting  But why even bother using dating apps  Just date in real life if you don t wanna take the risk

Reddit,I can sense her energy has dropped since the first date  Do I just cut my losses ,I feel like our messaging is very one sided since our first date a week ago and the interest has dropped from her side  I can sense the energy and effort dropping a bit  She does reply  she will ask me a q - but if I reply  she won t reply until maybe the next day  Do I just cut my losses       Key points  She s a doctor and a lecturer  Always always busy  She s    and I m        I live   hours away each way  So   to see her  I think this was an issue for her as she wanted more closer comfort     She did say at the end of the first date see uou next time     My messages are asking her questions  and How s your day going etc  To which she replies late less  and like I said    The first   days after our date she was doing long hospital calls to is abou    hour shifts  So was tired  So I thought her replies will be less because of this     As of now  we haven t booked our second date yet    shall I just ask her for it

Reddit,Polish women  oh my god ,Just got back from a  -day adventure in Poland and my mind is blown  I ve used Bumble on other trips  including Antalya  Turkey  Bruges  Belgium  Malaga  Spain  Cannes  France  and an hour at the Frankfurt Airport  and there s always a nice little boost with decent-looking women  But holy shit  I ve never seen such unbelievably gorgeous and younger women as in Poland    Unfortunately I couldn t date any while I was there because I was traveling with someone  I had a quick lunch with one of them because she was nearby  but the others are now just contacts for later maybe  Now I m wondering if I should move there  I don t get why it s so different  Poland is not a poor country  And these women weren t poor and desperate with five kids  They were normal women  educated  cultured  working good jobs  verified profiles  I ve got better acquainted with a couple and connected on LinkedIn  There s nothing sketchy -- they re just normal and gorgeous and available   In Paris  where I live   I do rather well with likes and matches  But French women tend to date their own age  I m     so most of my matches are   -    They re usually reasonably good looking but nothing to write home about  But my god  these Polish women were mostly much younger    -    and incredibly beautiful  Even the late-  s and early-  s were very slim and attractive    So what gives  Is there a shortage of men in Poland  Or is Bumble just really popular there  Or maybe I just have a look that Polish women are into  I have no idea  but I never got hits like that anywhere 
Reddit,Online Dating with a history of body dysmorphia,Hey everyone  first-time poster to this subreddit  hope you can help me with my situation   Firstly I m a   -year-old male  I ve never been in a relationship  besides once when I was very young  or even been out on a date    I m also very introverted  please don t confuse that with being antisocial  and don t have a social circle of friends  have one friend who I text every now and then but that s it  so my only real entry to dating is dating apps   Over the past year  I ve felt like I would like to start to share my life with someone else  I ve pondered this on and off for a while now and have created accounts on various dating apps  Bumble  Boo   Hinge   Not Tinder as I don t really see that as a dating app   The problem is for most of my life since I was a teenager I ve never really liked my appearance and I actively avoid looking at myself if I can help it since it just makes me feel uncomfortable  I personally feel confident in myself as a person and don t have problems talking to strangers but having photos of myself taken or having to take photos of myself just feels uncomfortable   Since dating apps solely rely on photos this makes having an attractive profile rather difficult  I can force myself to take photos of myself but they would all be selfies  due to how I don t really have a social circle or have the thought to take photos of myself when out and about as that feels very alien to me  and a profile just of selfies to me looks weird   I also suffer from hair loss and have been shaving my head bald since I was     personally doesn t bother me and I think has made me less conscious of my appearance over the years but let s be honest a bald   -year-old isn t going to be the most appealing individual      Maybe online dating isn t the right route for me but since speed dating isn t really a thing for my age group or that I have friends to set me up not sure what else to do   I would love more experienced individuals to share their wisdom with me  How would someone like myself try and make my profile more appealing  Is online dating not for me and if not what else is there available   Thank you for taking the time to read this

Reddit,I m bad at online dating,I f    got back to the country three months ago and decided I wanted to start looking for a relationship  I live in a small community so finding other queer women can be a bit difficult  There s a couple of cities around me so I thought online dating might be a good idea  my sister met her husband thay way after all   I ve gotten a few matches but without warning the girls stop replying  I can t see anything wrong in my messages so I have to assume it s because they found the conversation boring  I tend to get along really well with people in person so I m starting to think I must be a bad virtual conversationalist  I m thinking of quitting apps but I still want to meet someone   This is more of a lame rant I guess than anything useful  but does anyone have tips for getting better at this or alternatives to meeting people in less busy cities

Reddit,My Self-Confidence is gone and I ve thrown in the towel ,Before I discuss what I want to discuss  there are a few things that I ask you to keep in mind  This article is coming from a   M that s around     -     in height and has been on  rd shift for the past    years  As you read along  I m sure you ll understand why that information is at the forefront of this post   I haven t been with anyone in my state since          years old at the time  and most of the time since then  I ve either been single or had a long-distance thing going on  Never been on a date  been missing out on everything related to dating in-person relationships   Within the last   years  I ve only been in one relationship that lasted a little over a month in       massive regret there  and had spent   years combined on OLD between   different periods  September      to February      and April      until this past week   I ve gone through    different apps sites  but I ll only be covering   that I ve used because the   that I ll talk about are ones that I used more than once  The other   were pretty much dead and not noteworthy    Facebook Dating  The service is honestly the most dead one that I ve ever used  First time using the platform  no likes or matches  Second time  same exact thing  I honestly don t know how anyone has success on there   POF  Can t trust that platform  one bit  The amount of bots that I came across is just mind-boggling during both periods that I used their service and I can t return there due to this   OkCupid    match last time around caused me to talk to my friend Taylor  but I left in February      due to a moment that I don t think should really be explained  Second time around  also had only   match and the woman eventually wiped her profile shortly after briefly messaging me  Likes didn t happen very often   Tinder    matches the first time around    never messaged me back    unmatched randomly after we seemed to get along rather nicely in DMs  and the  rd one moved out of the state not too long after we matched   Second time around    match  she swiped right first and she unmatched with me the morning after I sent an introductory message without replying back  and hardly ever any likes   I don t know what s caused such dead periods in my time on the services  but it honestly feels like the combination of my physical height and work schedule have just driven everyone away   I know that some people will tell me to have more self-confidence  but I want to ask you all this  How much self-confidence would you have if you were    years old  your physical height has been your Achilles heel for your entire life  your work schedule has stopped you from even having a social life  and you ve had pretty much no success on the OLD world   I closed my last   accounts this past Friday  Tinder and OkCupid  and I ve just lost motivation  To myself personally  it feels like there isn t a place in the dating world of any sort for someone like myself  I can understand people having preferences for a significant other  but some of those preferences are so common and are things that I can t change  like women preferring men of a specific height at a minimum   It feels like I ve been dealt a rough hand within all of this and I can t find any reason to stick with OLD  Only reason I got into it is because it s hard to find time to go out when your  rd shift schedule makes it hard to even have a social life of all things  since everyone I know has the opposite schedule of myself   I m honestly lost now and I have no idea on what to do anymore  Any legit feedback would be appreciated on this  thank you

Reddit,Texting energy - overthinking ,I    M  matched with someone    F  last week and we were initially exchanging long texts - big chunky paragraphs back and forth  The texts were quite flirty and then we moved to texting off Hinge  It was going well  we were still messaging a lot and she would send goodnight and good morning texts   Now  here s the plot twist  we re in different cities  New York City for me  Albany for her   I figured  why not do a Facetime call since our schedules don t allow us to visit for the next few weeks  Surprisingly  it went on for hours  yeah  I know  against the  short and sweet  advice from this sub on Facetime calls   We clicked  the conversation flowed  and afterwards she said the time passed very quickly  and we agreed to do it again tomorrow   However  since that day  the texting from her end has slowed down a bit  We still exchange messages  -  times a day but I have been putting more effort than before into continuing the conversation  I don t mind this as I m naturally a texty texter but I don t to come off as needy and scare her off   I m just assuming that this is a combination of  a  when we matched it was the weekend so she had a lot more free time to send long messages and  b  the initial heavy texting phase is over especially because we spoke for so long on that call  We are also speaking tomorrow so she may not see the need to text a lot if we re going to be speaking for a long time again tomorrow   Now I m just looking for thoughts on this as I do like her  I guess the other obvious alternatives are that she just isn t a big texter  initial texting phase aside  or she s no longer as interested after talking to me  although I hope this is not the case    Any advice or thoughts 
Reddit,What i did wrong  my tinder match ghosted me after like   messages ,Hello everyone  i have a genuine question  i have been playing around with tinder  and after like   month of nothing i got a match   I m    and the girl was      We started talking normally   Me  Hello  how are you   She  Hi i m fine  and you  Me  im happy for you  i m very good with a little of cold lol Me  From what part of the city are you  She  Really  Im actually with a little of hot  She  im from xxxxxx and you  Me  It s been very cold here lately  already in the afternoon if it s hot Me  i live in xxxxxxx  Me  What do you like to do on your free time     no more replies of her    I was trying to have a normal conversation with her to later try to get a date with her or something  but nothing     did i scared her out 
Reddit,Women s negative profiles,I see a lot of women who don t even bother to say anything about themselves in their profile  But better yet they rather use their biospace to give a list of all the things they don t want in a match  Such as   if you re XX swipe left    Or some are just the lazy   ask to know more    I ve heard from women that having things on your profile like being independent or having a car and a house apparently isn t attractive    But on the flip side do women really think that s going to attract us

Reddit,Is eharmony worth paying for and how to avoid being scammed by them ,I ve heard that their billing practices are very shady  Should I use a prepaid card to pay for this or something    BTW  I am solely looking for a relationship that will lead to marriage  The age bracket I m attracted to is middle-aged and beyond if it matters  no I m not young myself  
Reddit,What do people have in mind when they say they want someone who has  ambition  ,This is something I see mentioned at times   When I read it  what I imagine is  person who steps on others to get ahead in life    I m guessing people more mean  has higher aspirations than working a survival job and playing video games    But idk  so I ask   Kinda related  I also wonder about phrases like  knows who you are and what you want  
Reddit,Is there a dating app that I m only shown to people I choose ,There s a couple of men I am trying to avoid seeing me on the app for safety reasons  It scares me to think they could see me on there and then start harassing me in my life again  especially because I m back in my hometown again   Is there an app that men won t see me unless I pick them  Is that what bumble is  I just don t want to not know who s seeing me 
Reddit,Being asked to swap to  rd parties apps  Always a red flag ,In my one year experience  zero dates so far   on   different apps  being asked to talk via snap or what s app or chatterbox  has always ended up them asking me for money or getting ready to lead up to that point  I ve been at the point for quite some time that I will automatically stop talking to anyone that either immediately asks me to switch to a  rd party app  or after a day or two of convos then asked me to swap  Sometimes when I think they might be legit  I say can we just exchange numbers instead  And the only and rare responses I ve had that seem legit are  I don t want to give my phone number to someone I don t know yet   I then quit responding    Am I missing on opportunities or is being asked to swap to third party apps a waste of time to pursue 
Reddit,Is moving away from the dating app REALLY fast a red flag to a spammer  or am I just dumb,Title lol    I know those apps aren t necessarily the most fun to chat on  but it always feels so weird when it s SOOO fast so I wanna know if its more common or if I m totally misjudging haha  I ve moved to other apps sometimes thinking  it d work  but then I get ghosted and then sometimes I could swear the amount of spam I get on those accounts goes up when I give it out  like from Crypto and other spam scams   Maybe the scams are unrelated  but are my worries justified  or am I just being a dumb online dater who s turning down tons of potential matches     Edit for context     year old male
Reddit,Should I keep my bachata  zouk social dancing vid in my pro     Why they look for someone who dances but then,I m not trying to gatekeep but I ve reached pretty adequate social dancing levels with Braz Zouk  Bachata comes super easy now  I understand that I should probably change my bachata sensual video with a random follow during a big social dance fest but even when it s zouk or something really platonic or mutual looking like salsa I get mixed results   It s not all bad  But it makes me wonder  Anyone else who are actual social  dancers  put a vid in their pro  Is it appropriate  No way else to interpret  they ask  someone or look for someone who dances  but probably never actually social danced  And I understand social dancing scenes everywhere can be pretty small  hence why I do not dance in the scene lol   It s just now a funny situation  yes  you can see us dancing with alot of people of opposite genders but alot  if not  most of it is just pretty platonic even if it s sensual bachata  What do they mean by dancing anyway 
Reddit,is it catfishing to only use pics i look good in  what about if i use a pic with a filter , obviously ppl put pics where they look good  but what if i only look good from a few angles     like when ppl take pictures of me I look really bad but when I take pics of myself i look good  i also smile ugly in pictures other ppl take bc i can t see my own face    so if i only put selfies where i look good and not the pics ppl take of me is that considered catfishing    and what if one pic has a filter on it  i used one picture that had a filter on it  i liked it bc i think i look d cent  but it s not a filter that changes facial features shape it just makes the pic a bit brighter and my skin smoother  mainly the smooth skin  is using a pic with filtered smooth skin catfishing  for this particular picture my brother said it doesn t look like me  but my friends said it does look like me but with makeup  tbf my brother also said i don t look like me in an unfiltered pic where i was wearing makeup
Reddit,Dating abroad,Hello  was wondering where you guys would say is the best place to date in America or outside of America where women are more independent  I m pretty burnt out and extremely jaded on dating here  The biggest issue I encounter are women who treat me like an ATM machine and refuse to pay for anything  Are there any places in America where women are independent and pay their fair share  I m actually planning on traveling to Europe to see what it s like and have heard great things  Have a nice trip planned to northern Europe and have heard great things about Germany  Any other suggestions  Money is not really an issue just looking for someone who is genuine

Reddit,Do you have more success with online dating then in real life,Meeting people in real life seems to becoming more frowned upon however when you meet someone in person it is so much easier to display your personality and build a better connection and i think this is one of the main reasons that getting an actual date online is harder  has anyone here found that arranging actual dates with people you meet online to lead to a lot more no shows and ghosting 
Reddit,Tinder and being unsuccessful,Tinder is the only online dating app that I get the least amount of likes  Literally none in about   months lol  Hinge  Bumble  and a few other apps i get a good amount of matches and attention    Whats up with Tinder  Could it be that having my settings show Long term is killing it  Idk 
Reddit,Meeting a guy from an OLD  did he want a kiss ,Met a guy on Hinge for the first time and he drove me home  I m    and he knew that  he s around    or something  When he took me home  we were in front of my house  He suddenly put his left arm behind my headrest  I said goodbye and left  his reaction was kind of disappointed I guess    I think he wanted a kiss or something  I don t know  I m awful with social cues 
Reddit,Why would you unmatch with them ,Hi men of Reddit   For those who ve used online dating apps  any of you ever set up a first date with someone and seem really eager then unexpectedly decide to unmatch them the next day  If so  why   I   F  matched with a    M  yesterday and we had a great conversation about where we live  fave foods  and wanting kids  He seemed to be looking to settle down since he had  not sure  about kids on his profile and he said he really wants kids but felt he was getting old  Asked to go on a dinner date this Friday night  Then ended the night with a good night beautiful handsome  Then this morning I checked the app and we were still matched  Now our conversation is gone     I know I shouldn t think too much into it but I m seriously genuinely curious as to why anyone would do that after showing interest and effort in asking you on a date  Just didn t expect a guy his age to behave like that 
Reddit,messenger apps vs phone numbers,so like just today a guy goes   I hate the messenger on here  do you have another way to chat   so I give him my number and then he says   I usually don t text this early in getting to know someone do you have something like snapchat  kik  or tiktok  I don t understand why 
Reddit,Things I ve learned dating as a man,   Physical attraction is very important   More important than most people are comfortable admitting  so my best advice is to make yourself handsome   A lot of looking handsome is simply looking healthy     Have a haircut that compliments your face well     Good skin care   I use hydrating masks from Facetory on amazon that work well     Find an exercise routine you enjoy doing and make it your hobby     Be well groomed and wear clothes that fit you well   Wear an accessory too like a bracelet or something      Have a good first date spot that you know very well   This allows you to lead the way   I know where to park  what to recommend and different places nearby we can relocate to if the date is going well      Accept that dating has a brutality to it   It s like boxing  don t be surprised if you get punched in the face if you re in the ring   I ve been ghosted  led on  confused  heart broken   It just comes with the territory   I think out of the dozens of women I ve dated from Hinge  I ve gotten closure once   Literally just once   The others had me scratching my head   My best friend said it best   Don t fall in love until you ve seen her butthole at least   times       Don t blow through multiple dates being a platonic chit chat buddy   If you ask to kiss her and she says she s not ready  at least she s now looking at you as a sexual and romantic creature   You really have to get the tingles to happen when dating   It s really hard shifting from platonic to sexual when you re on the  rd- th date   The underling romantic tone needs to be established fairly quickly   I ALWAYS kiss by the  nd date assuming there s potential there   This puts me in a good spot for the upcoming  rd date      Get good at reading body language and signals   Women make moves too like getting really close to you  lingering by your car at the end of the date  giving you the eyes   whatever      Be genuine   Highlight your good qualities      First kiss is a chemistry check   What things have you learned 
Reddit,OLD apps are just designed to take your money,  M here  no kids and never married  I ve been trying my luck at OLD again recently and it has not been good  In my   s I had some success with getting dates on these apps but now    the market is is not good to say the least  Just about everyone in this age bracket has some sort of baggage  My real complaint right now is the disgusting amount of monetization involved with these apps   Free versions are basically useless so you have to pay a subscription  and as if that s not enough they are constantly trying to upsell you on things like superlikes and boosts  You have no way of knowing if this money you re spending is going to yield any sort of result so its like throwing your money into a pit  And as we all know  the companies that own these apps havr a vested interest in keep you on them so they can maintain profit growth  Ugh  I m just so put off by this crap now  I just wish I could meet someone in person  the normal way  like we are supposed to meet people 
Reddit,Not sure if I should ask her out  Not feeling enough ,Ive been talking to this girl for about a month now online since she lives in another state and i would say we are good friends  We flirt with each other every so often  Im not sure if she is interested in me  I made a post a week or so ago that she said she knew that i liked her and asked if i like her in a subtle way  I Think  she was asking if i thought of her as attractive  Then being an awkward person i kinda didnt answer her question completely and i was flustered and didn t know what to say  Right now i wanna tell her that i like her and that I was just nervous when that happened and that I know the answer now  I feel as though it could be to late being it was almost   weeks ago  Also im having this feeling like im not enough  because i don t really have anything going for me at the moment  I Don t have a job or to much of a life at the moment   I am working on it  just i don t feel like i would be enough  I have goals and stuff I ve just have been having a rough patch recently  so it s been draining my confidence  Also t
Reddit,Did tinder get harder than a couple of years ago ,M      here I used to get   -   matches per day and now only get    using the same photos    Did it become more competitive and everyone has started photomaxxing and looks maxing or did it become pay to win and you need tinder gold now    Anyone else with similar experience 
Reddit,Why is online dating so confusing and how should a man approach the insanity ,Everyone is so different  I don t even know what to expect from each experience anymore  I met crazy narcissists  women not over husbands  women not over lovers  women with dozens of male friends and not a photo with one  women who hang out and refuse to kiss you  women who have the best sex of their lives with you and never speak with you again  women who want you for your money  women who want you for papers  women who want a dad for their young kids  women who talk about living together on the  nd date  women who say being intimate with you makes them relive past trauma  women who leave in the middle of a  th date because you re  not touching them enough  women who bring up political issues and then ghost you for having a different view  despite respecting theirs  women who tell you they are in love with you and cheat a few days later  women who actually ask you for money  women who have abandoned their children  women who match with you on   apps and each time ghost you when they realize you won t be available for her   days a week because you have kids  women who pursue you and multiple other men at the same time  while lying to your face about what they are doing that night   Mixed in with that are a small number of decent and genuine women  maybe     of the sufficiently presentable online dating profile pool     This one is for the ladies who are not the above   How do you expect a man to navigate these landmines and take a chance on   person  when online dating is so warped   Most men don t have the radar women do and most women don t give off obvious red flags like guys do  so we have to date multiple women and hope one will prove to us that she is genuinely interested  is normal  kind  giving  available and not spreading her legs for a new guy every week  no judgment if that s you  it s just not who I want 
Reddit,Are we dating the same guy fb group, I m a female who joined the group as an active online dater  The rules are  don t share screenshots details outside of the group  Nothing leaves the group  The group states it was created to help women who online date stay away from bad men  But the group isn t about that  It s full of jaded women who turn on eachother  A woman will post a pic of a guy  talk about her bad experience and either warn or seek advice  Majority of women will defend her in the comments  but there s always that  one sneaky woman lurking that sends the post to the guy  I myself posted two different men on different occasions asking if any girls had tea on him  Both of my post got back to the men from someone in that group  I made a post about the snitching  And I got banned  I got banned for speaking up  For saying this group is full of jaded and sneaky women  These women are not looking out for eachother at all  Now granted someone of the men posted did do some nasty things to alot of women in the same city  But for the most part  most posts are women complaining about stupid shit  Omg we went on a first date with great chemistry and he didn t text me back  Or howcome he doesn t text me everyday  A bunch of women in their   s who are too busy analyzing every action a man does  A bunch of miserable women  I can t believe I joined that shit 
Reddit,So I ve gotten back into OLD after   yrs  What gives  ,I seriously can t see who likes my profile now without paying   Like wtf  society and everything is a fucking joke 
Reddit,Facebook dating,Anyone else get guys trying to video chat and CALLING   I don t understand why anyone would think to do that to a stranger  I immediately block anyone who tries I think it s so weird  I ve had it happen way to many times then is normal
Reddit,Do you prefer to message on the apps or exchange numbers ,I m curious how other people are  I definitely check my phone messages more and try to move good conversations off the app within a day or    I don t really check dating apps at work but I m checking my phone messages at least every couple hours  It seems like once we get off the app they respond less than they did on the app  Like they would respond within an hour usually and then they might send a couple messages a day and that s it  This even happens when they ask me for my number  It s weird and kinda defeats the purpose to me so I m just wondering others opinions on it 
Reddit,Photos on OLD,So  I do a decent amount of profile reviews on here  Mainly for Hinge cause people actually seem to take that sub seriously     Is anyone else getting tired of the  I don t take photos  excuse  I know some of yall are gonna come for my throat  but it s mainly men who say this   I don t understand this  Why on earth would you expect people to swipe on you when you have photos that are blurry  very obviously several years old  you look different throughout the photos due to them being a mix of extremely outdated and new  or your style is very inconsistent  from full head of hair  to suddenly bald-also full on beard to clean shaven   The photos with bad lighting where you re in the shadows  too far away  in a huge group of friends where we can t easily spot you  Hell I had a guy like me a few days ago using  photos from his wedding day   He didn t properly crop his  ex  wife out-she was still slightly visible cutting the cake with him off to the side   When people ask in the reviews why the photos these people chose are so horrible  the response is always  I don t take a lot of photos     It just doesn t make sense  It s not shallow to swipe left on someone because you have no idea what they look like or their photos are extremely low effort  You can t legitimately be upset that folk are swiping left on you when you haven t even put an ounce of effort into photos   Ask friends to take photos  If you don t have friends-tripod and a timer are your new friends  There really just isn t any excuse in this day and age to not have decent photos for your profile  Btw for the guys-if your friends make fun of you for wanting to snap some nice shots so that you can improve your OLD profile  they are not good friends imo  No friend would shame you make you feel bad for trying to put your best foot forward   This post is regarding bad photos ONLY btw  I m not addressing the other complicated facets of OLD  just the photo situation 
Reddit,Interest can be there initially and then fizzle out,I see sometimes people saying stuff like  I was talking to this person for a while and then suddenly they ghosted and it s cause they have so many other people to talk to   or  they just wanted validation   and I feel like all you re doing is inflicting damage on your own self-esteem by assuming that s the reason  They could have no one else they re talking to and still bow out because they just stopped being interested for reasons that have nothing to do with you   Just for some examples  they could have started feeling attached to you and got cold feet  they could have been interested the whole time and then it petered out  something you said could have reminded them of an old ex or traumatic experience that gave them the ick even if there wasn t anything that would be off about it to most people  they could have been ok with it at first at a distance and then something made it feel too  real   so they got scared  they could have noticed something about you that is a dealbreaker for them  that they hadn t noticed before 
Reddit,How should I  F    make my dating profile if I want a casual relationship FWB with a man who is not a creep ,I recently got out of a two year relationship and am going back and forth contemplating whether I should download a dating app  Before I used to use tinder but most guys I met there were    Not the kindest  and while I definitely didn t properly set boundaries at the time which I now know how to  I would still like to minimize the risk of ending up meeting people who are completely unempathetic and frankly  sleezy    So how can I make it clear what I m looking for  avoid leading people on whilst simultaneously hopefully getmatches from people who want the same things but are nice people who respect others  Is there anything I should make sure to include or avoid in my profile  Have any of you met someone you ended up in this type of relationship with on a dating app  and how was the process of getting there 
Reddit,Is he ghosting me ,We made date plans for this weekend after him being flirty  texting back immediately  and initiating the planning  We talked about when to meet and he said whenever I m free  We decided on where together and then I asked him a few random surface level questions and nothing since    Kinda embarrassed that he is ghosting me but why go through all of that  I m at a loss of what to do 
Reddit, Something casual  date,Supposed to meet up today  Both of us know what we want and what to expect I guess  but is there anything to beware of in these sorts of encounters   If not  how do you go about initiating anything  like what do u even do on these sort of adventures  Guess my plan is just talk openly like I have  but I ve always been more the  nice guy   Was in a relationship   years so it s been a while since any dating and kinda a first for casual   Just looking for any pointers  dangers  any sort of advice I guess 
Reddit,If eharmony decides to close your account  do you get a refund ,Hypothetical scenario   If someone is legally separated and has filed for divorce but it s still in process  not granted yet  and eharmony finds this out  they will close your account  right    If this happens  do they give you a refund or just keep the   million dollars you paid upfront 
Reddit,Physical attraction vs personality,Why is it that some people can be a        and the convo be super slow  low effort  and then someone comes up with a great personality but not attracted to but you just know in the back of your mind that you would rather have someone that you re super attracted to instead and would rather wait for that  Am I stupid for wanting to wait for someone I m super attracted to  
Reddit,Lack of Communication,Does it bother you if you match with someone and they suck at texting throughout the day   I matched with someone from a dating app and everything s going fine over the weekend  and then they had asked me out for dinner tomorrow and since then our conversations have been slim  Like I wouldn t hear from them for hours before they finally message me back the next day which is today     I told them bluntly that I do like communication prior to going out on a date etc like texting   and they said that they are not fond of texting and I told them that it s fine and I would be down for like phone calls or FaceTime    Last I heard from them was when I was getting off from work today at    asking them about a time for tomorrow s dinner date  not even sure if it s happening tomorrow or not    Does lack of communication bother you when it comes to online dating  
Reddit,The closest I ll ever get to being a woman on OLD ,I ve come to understand that women get tons of likes all the time just for being a woman  There are a bunch of horny dudes who think they have what it takes to score  I don t kid myself in that department  I m a strong    with an okay personality    But Facebook has a friendship option  which gay guys try to use it as a way to try to get me to turn  That level of male ego is pretty amusing  No  John who is     I already know we have nothing in common  Go find a bar that has a predominately older gay customer base and hit on those guys 
Reddit,Unmatched after asking to get to know them,Hey everyone   I got a match with a woman on a dating app and the we send a few texts back and forth  We chatted a bit for one night before she asks if I m looking for a long term relationship  She gives me her number but before I text her off the app I ask if I can get to know her a bit beforehand  After that she unmatched me  Did I dodge a bullet    Seems a bit fishy 
Reddit,Confirming date,  So matched with this guy on Hinge last week  We had a couple of back and forth convos and things moved to texting  He was was really responsive and asked for a date  We solidified that this Tuesday worked for us both  Last thing I said in our convo was asking a general question which he never replied to  This was on Wednesday last week  Haven t heard from him since    Should I just assume that the date is not happening  I m kinda leaning towards that at this point  He was pretty adamant about meeting so pretty shocked as to why build it all up for nothing 
Reddit,What kind of OLD apps worked for you  ,I have tinder and bumble   i did install Christian mingle the other day and it was rubbish       just you could message other people 
Reddit,AdvoDate com WARNING,Avodate com is a site full of fabricated profiles  I began investigating this site as I was worried my dad was getting scammed by a lady reportedly from Ukraine   This is all based off of my personal experience with the website    which is hosted in CA in the USA    This site does not contain real profiles  only fabricated ones  To confirm I created both a female and male account and searched for my dad s profile  active for several months  and the others I created by name  region and the profile ID   and none were visible           Why would a site do this  It s the only way to really get users to spend money and adhere to the site requirement of not sharing contact information between each other until certain requirements are met  they spin this as being for the safety of users    The requirements are spending    days chatting  without a gap of    hrs  AND spending      credits on chats  letters  and pics  ect and only then are is this option to request contact information even available to you  This is a cost of over        just for the option to request contact information from   single user  And as one would expect  these fake people you chat with will tell you they  must  adhere to these website requirements  because it s written in the rules         Every chat message costs coins  every letter costs coins  after the first free letter   extra pictures cost coins  watching videos of course also cost coins           It s obvious  if you ve created a real relationship with a real person you would be more than willing to save some money and share contact details  But you can t  because the profiles are all fake   
Reddit,Back to OLD after    years  What the hell happened ,  M here   I ve had very  very brief exchanges with a few different women over the past month  All of them have been me trying to ask questions  start a conversation  and I get  -  word answers and they don t ask anything about me   Is this what OLD is like now    
Reddit,Place with plenty of single women,Hey guys      I m deep into the dating coach world and maximized my profile - I get thousands of likes on these apps  almost every woman I go for is a match  Still  it s a massive pain - the ghosting - the painful process to arrange a date - the cancelled dates and flakiness in general      I hate it  I m doing it full time now for a couple of weeks  due to a accident and surgery  I had endless time on my phone      That it requires so much time and effort to actually go on a date is beyond crazy and not worth it       I ve been to party tourist destination in Greece this summer  where I had three threesomes in one week with six women  It was so easy to pull girls  But now that it s winter  I wonder if you know places where you easily meet single women that are actually approachable  who want you as much as you want them      Because trust me guys  it s all about the right place  Online dating sucks   for everyone    Most people that actually enjoy it are just people enjoying chatting  The match to date ratio is beyond horrific       So please tell me your favorite places to pick up women  in real life         x   B 
Reddit,There is still hope ,I spent the last few weeks getting to know a nice woman I met on hinge  She is a pretty sweet girl  well spoken  interesting background   we have some things in common    Things were progressing slower than I would have liked  but we are both busy so I was ok giving it time  A couple days ago I got a pretty polite message about chemistry not building  I felt it too  it happens  We had a short conversation and wished eachother well    Its not often in OLD that you get this type of ending  Its usually a ghost or fade away  Ive had to send a few of this type of message myself  but I think she was better at it than me and it was a nice change of pace    I may be back to the grind  but its nice to be reminded that good people are still out there even if they aren t the good person for you 
Reddit,Ghosting hurts,I know that being ghosted hurts us but this article talks about hurting the ghosters    https   greatergood berkeley edu article item ghosting  someone  may  hurt  you  as  much  as  it  hurts  them  https   greatergood berkeley edu article item ghosting someone may hurt you as much as it hurts them   Thoughts 
Reddit,I  M    hate OLD but it feels like my only option,There s not a single aspect to OLD I enjoy  It feels like it s commodifying people  it makes me more judgemental of people s physical appearances  it makes me question whether I m an  interesting  person  it absolutely tanks my self-esteem  I rarely get likes from people I find attractive  and even if I do match with someone they rarely ever chat  It s like they match just to match and not to pursue anyone  I ll usually ask something simple like how their day week has been  or if they have something to latch onto in their profile like a pet or an interesting job I ll ask a question about that  I ve had eight matches on Tinder with zero messages  almost twenty matches on Bumble with conversations that just suddenly dropped off for no reason  when I still had Hinge I think I had five matches with no conversations  It s miserable  All my life I ve been told I m a decent-looking guy  but depression and self doubt have always chalked that up to being empty flattery  Now it feels like those negative thoughts were right  and I just can t compete with guys who re actually attractive   I m in a graduate program so I m only ever around the same few people  and I m not interested in any of them  I have anxiety so I have a hard time making new friends and going places by myself  and although I m doing my best to work through that it still feels impossible to meet people who share my interests organically  Should I just give up on OLD entirely and focus all my energy on irl activities 
Reddit,She cancelled on me again and asked to reschedule,We were supposed to meet for dinner tonight for our second date  I got almost all the way there and sent her a text saying I was ten minutes away  I was already dropping my kid off with my ex  She called me said she wasn t feeling good  This is the second last minute cancellation she s pulled  She apologized several times on the phone and said she appreciated my understanding  I didn t give her a date to reschedule and I m just ready to say I m done  Should I give her three strikes before pulling the plug   Edit  I had time to think about it  I m going to just break it off  Being disrespected like this right away is probably a sign of what s to come if I pursue  I m clearly not important enough to her to keep plans  let alone  invest into a potential relationship 
Reddit,Judging people too quickly based on poor pictures,I don t really have a question or anything  it s just a comment about a lesson I just learned the hard way    I had a match with a woman on Hinge who had some common interests with me  but I was on the fence about her pictures  something just didn t quite spark my interest there   She definitely wasn t  ugly  or anything  but I also wasn t really attracted to her pictures  As a result  I probably didn t show that much enthusiasm in the chatting stage and our conversation fizzled out  I wasn t too upset about that because there was no point leading her on if I wasn t really interested   Anyway  I recently ran into her profile again with different pictures  and this time I thought  damn  she is actually quite attractive    I haven t swiped right on her because I have to take the L for missing my chance the first time  I only have my dumb self to blame for that   But anyway  just wanted to share this experience    I m certainly no looker myself  but I guess I am also guilty of judging people too quickly 
Reddit,Any way to be not appear offensively foreign in the us dating scene ,My reasoning   I went abroad for a few months to Asia and realized that I am not as ugly as I believed I am in the us  I actually got a lot of matches every other day    Of course not all of them were  real  or some were people who changed their locations  But I did match a lot  I did talk  and even met  A lot wanted marriage partners and I was just a visitor so often it would end in online convo or a coffee date  It was nice to be able to meet and talk with new people though    I come back to the us  Only match with someone who wants to talk and not meet  then out of nowhere unmatched    It must be the outward appearance where I m not even given the opportunity to be judged as a person  Just some ch    online    My profile does say I am an us born citizen and that has helped a bit  but probably only for people reading it  I don t want to wear a baseball hat eating apple pie as my profile pic since it feels a bit on the nose  but is that what it takes 
Reddit,Should i have gone or did i do the right thing ,Last week I had a date almost set up with a nice guy but I backed out a day before because i felt like I d be wasting his time and resources  since he s a student that also works and im not seriously looking for a relationship  I honestly dont know if I should ve just gone and met him but thinking of him driving an hour to treat me to something just makes me feel really guilty  I have avoidant attachment and am working through it at therapy but im not sure if its correlated
Reddit,Thinking of going full geek for a while,Back to OLD after a loooong time out of the dating pool     m   And  I hate it  I hate the nickel-and-diming of the apps  the slew of fake accounts  the interfaces that barely allow for any personal information beyond statistics  etc  etc  You hear it all the time   Plus  I m old and out of shape  So frankly  even if those issues didn t exist  I have no illusions that I d otherwise be slaying it    I realized that the only time I m having fun is responding to the profiles that have geek-related prompts  Or better yet  the profiles that are full-on geek-girl  Comics  cartoons  horror movies  video games  anime   that s my wheelhouse  That s what I m doing when I m not on these apps  trying to convince myself I could get into hiking or kayaking or sports to impress women I have little to nothing in common with  Why not lean into it   So I ve made my own profiles look less like resumes  and I m gonna start saving my allotments of free likes messages for specific women  My green flags are gonna be words like  Marvel    Playstation   and  Star Wars   My super-likes or whatever are gonna go to the profiles that have pictures of cosplay  And my conversations are gonna stop leading with standbys like   What s your dog s name   and  So  what do you do for a living    I know full well this is gonna turn my already-unsteady stream of matches into an imperceptible trickle  but the hell with it  I wasn t lighting the world on fire trying to date as an adult  maybe at least I ll have a little fun trying to date as a man-child 
Reddit,This is why I m weary of OLD,So I ve been using OLD for a month or so  Last Sunday  so not even a full week  I matched with this guy and we exchanged numbers  Right away he says he s looking for something long term and monogamous  which is all good with me    We set up a day we d meet when I got back in town and then things went way overboard  In our second phone call he asks if I m all in for this because he doesn t have time for someone who can t be all in for a relationship  Okay  so red flag      Then it s   well I need constant checkins and attention  red flag     Then my kids are with me for the weekend and I thought he d understand and give some space so I can spend time with them  Then I get messages about needing to be a priority despite my kids  Red flag     Then today I got a long call about him not knowing if I have the passion that he needs and I need to be committed to this  He would say if I had doubts let him know so he wouldn t be wasting his time   So I gave it thought and told him I would not be able to give to him everything he wants and then I m berated with messages about being mentally ill and a nut job   WTF  Please tell me he s the exception and not the rule when it comes to online dating  because holy hell  I cannot take that kind of intensity and behavior 
Reddit,What s something you ve learned from dating that typically isn t preached here ,Title is my question   Is there anything you ve experienced out there that younger you wish you really knew   Maybe even something controversial to share 
Reddit,Dating but still swiping    ,TL DR  I     F  have seriously hit it off with a    M   I m extremely interested in him and he has made it clear  or is at least pretending to be  seriously interested in me  With that being said  I see he s still on the apps  I want to communicate to him about it but I feel it s too soon don t want to pressure him   Here s the story   He   I matched about three weeks ago on the apps  had great banter  and agreed to meet up  Before him and I met  I told him that I wasn t interested in not available for a relationship  but we could be friends  But then we met in person and by the end of the date  we were making out on the park bench  He even invited me to go to India with him for the next week  The next day we agreed to get a drink together  talked laughed for hours  and hooked up  When I insinuated that maybe one day he d find somebody worth getting off of the apps for  he just said  maybe    It s been a few weeks since then and we ve both been traveling but keeping up extensively through very flirtatious text messages  I ve admittedly grown more attached but see that he s still actively swiping on the apps    I want to go with the flow and play it out but I m terrified of getting my heart broken again 
Reddit,Am I being unreasonable ,So I was texting with a guy on Hinge  We have been messaging on Hinge for about two weeks  But some days we wouldnt message for days and its usually me initiating but one day he asked me for my number so we can text on whatsapp since hes not on Hinge alot  So I gave him my number  We talked for like a day  Then he stopped responding for like almost a day despite seeing him online  From my past experiences this is a red flag and Im just going to be ghosted  I assumed he is probably not that interested    so I asked him to delete my number    I dont like people storing my number if theyre never even going to message me  Like what for   He asked  why    I responded  why would you keep my number if you re not interested    He responded  thats interesting  I dont have time to chat every second I was driving to work when you texted me and then I forgot    I didnt respond  That sounds terrible to me    Should I have given him the benefit of the doubt  I waited like almost    hours  And he forgot to text  I feel like would he have even remembered me eventually  How long should I wait before considering it over 
Reddit,Profiles that do not state what the person is looking for ,I haven t been on any apps for a few yrs   I do think one thing I ignored back than   That turned out to be time wasted  were profiles with no effort  Ex    No bio written  Or they didn t specify what they were looking for  Or they were open to short term  friends  and long term  So my question is    If you re looking for long term relationship  do you pass on profiles with no bio  Or profiles that are open to  any  type of relationship  And just focus on the ones that say only long term 
Reddit,How Can I Verify If Someone Is Real ,I was recently recommended to try online dating  I tried Tinder  found escorts  Bumble  found girls who don t care if you exist  Hily  OKCupid  PoF and now Tantan  I have trouble figuring out who s real  Any ideas 
Reddit,Why so many say they re looking for someone  loving  ,Isn t that given  I mean  aren t we all looking for love  Do you think that means they had a previous spouse or S O  that wasn t very kind or affectionate 
Reddit,How do men feel dating women    and above ,Just wondering if men factor in that women     may have their bio clock ticking  or have experienced that she might be more in a rush to get married or have babies  Do women in their   s seem more desperate on OLD 
Reddit,Are dating apps a waste of time  Does it ever get better ,I    M  have used dating apps on and off for over a year and probably spent like      hours and       on it by now  All I ve gotten out of it was dates with two girls  one of whom I was not compatible with at all  and the other just ended in a fling with nothing serious  I m honestly just reconsidering what s important to me right now in my life because dating seems impossible for me as an engineering student right now with a shitton of schoolwork to manage   Does it get better when you get older  This shit is exhausting and it takes me fucking forever to get any dates   And before anyone suggests  I am social irl  I go to the gym   times a week and I am focused on my career so I m not a  lazy bum  who needs self-improvement  I am a part of multiple social groups but I ve never met a woman I clicked with irl  I ve only ever had dates from dating apps  I just don t wanna waste my fucking life on these stupid dating apps rather than just living my life and doing things that I actually like 
Reddit,How do you judge a person who gives the bare minimum effort in the convo and how do you handle it ,If a person sends messages that are  -  words and are not very thoughtful  I see   possible options       They have a developed personality but aren t a good writer and maybe they re better at talking      They have a developed personality but don t care to show it to you     They really dont have much of a personality  I believe in second chances and giving the benefit of the doubt so if they start showing bare minimum effort I assume its     So I ask if they want to video chat to give them a second chance  A part of me thinks Im being too forgiving because it doesnt take much to give more then the bare minimum and I should move on at the first sign of it but I also think what if Im skipping out on someone great because I assumed the worst 
Reddit,Advice needed  I just don t know how to do this ,It s pretty simple really I just don t know how to do the online dating thing  I ve always met women organically and we usually hit it off  I ve matched with   woman total so far and maybe get   messages from them before it just goes cold    I am trying to have a legitimate conversation to get to know them better but that doesn t seem to happen  I don t know what the expectation is for men but I just don t get how to do this  I can t read body language and the conversation seems forced when only going off a few pics and very few details    I started using dating sites cause I work in remote areas for long periods and travel extensively so it s been hard to find those organic interactions and meetings  Pretty much any advice would be helpful at this point 
Reddit,She never initiates conversation via text or phone,Started seeing this girl and we went on one date  I ve noticed that she never texts me or calls me  I m the one reaching out every other day  I do very much enjoy talking to her and our first date was really awesome  ended in a kiss and her request for a second date  When I do call her  she s very enthusiastic when she talks to me  almost like she s been waiting for me to call  I m probably looking too much into it but I ll give it one more date  but if she doesn t start initiating  I m going to reach out less frequently and see what happens  If after date three  if there is one  and she doesn t start initiating  I ll be moving on 
Reddit,What are best niche dating sites in China and other East Asia ,Tried international niche dating sites for subcultures  metal  emo  punk   but they have mostly anglophone members  who very rarely fit my standards  I like cute girls who facially resemble anime characters   and very few to none members from China and overall East Asia  where cuteness is much more often can be found  and so as result those sites for me where useless  Finding cute niche girls in Tinder  but there need to swipe through hundreds of basic females for reaching those I can culturally connect to  What are smaller niche dating sites with bigger presence of     -  yo cute non-basic girls from East Asia  And ones with possibility translate to english or russian language  or atleast easy enough to navigate by using online translator
Reddit,Has the Hinge algorithinm changed  or did i suddenly turn unattractive  Not getting any matches for months ,  x   B   Hey guys     year old man here         So hinge is by far my favourite dating app  i use it more than any other  Tinder and bumble always sucked for me  I ve been living in Montreal canada for  -  years and so far have been on approximately    dates  Not the biggest number but i used to get atleast a couple of matches per month  Out of all the dates i ve been on around     were from Hinge  I ve around a     matches and it was working fine till late summer last year  Unfortunately i ve been barely getting any matches this past year  i think in total i got around   -   matches since april of this year  For the past years it was relatively normal for me to go on atleast   or   dates from hinge per month  but now i haven t been on a hinge date in  -  months  Does anyone know if the algorithm for hinge changed  or if there is some other issue  Some of my friends similarly struggled awhile back         Now i m not the most physically attractive guy at     and thin body type  i m also indian  But i ve always matched with and managed to go on dates with some really cute girls  And my pics have never been better  So either i m thinking it s because of three possible reasons            The algorithim changed           My age      is detrimental           The bad reputation and memes of indian guys have gotten so bad it s pretty common knowledge and girls are no longer willing to give them a chance         What do you guys think  Hopefully it s not    because it s completely out of my control
Reddit,I like a guy who s dating multiple people and it bothers me  How do I let it go ,We went out on   dates and We dont know each other that long but thinking about him with others bugs me  How do I let that go 
Reddit,Is a personal gift before having even met yet too much ,So I have been talking to a guy I matched with for almost a week now  We hit it off over chat and set up a online date since the distance between us made it tricky to set up an in person date for the time being  The online date went great and there is definitely chemistry there  I was feeling pretty excited and was looking forward to next time  Anyway  he suddenly sent me a digital drawing of one of my pets  he s into art  and it made me feel instantly stressed and weirded out  I haven t even met him yet and he s already sending me personal gifts    Am I wrong for feeling like this is too much  It s making me want to back off but I honestly don t know if this would be right decision  I struggle with an avoidant attachment style which has made me want to back off early with other guys aswell   I ve been trying to push through it and really give guys a chance  therapy has been helping   Now I don t know if my feelings are valid or if I should push through the uncomfortable feeling I have and still see where it goes  What do you guys think  Is he being too much  Is it a red flag

Reddit,What is your experience like with Bumble        ,I m   F  live in a big metropolitan city  Been single for the last     years    I ve been on and off Hinge  the matches and dates are better quality but they re just very few and far between   Tried tinder  more matches but poorer quality and majority of people just looking for hook ups    I was on Bumbe back in       and met an ex boyfriend through it  But that was a long time ago and I m sure things have changed    What is bumble like now  Are people mostly looking for hookups  Relationships  What are your matches like compared to other apps 
Reddit,Opinions on woman I just started dating wanting to bring sister and her sister s boyfriend on third date,We had talked about doing mini golf at a pretty cool place for our third date  When I texted her a link of the place and asked if she wants to do it on Sunday  she said she wants to  Then she said that her sister has been wanting to go there and asked if her sister and sister s boyfriend could meet us there   Personally  I haven t dated a woman who has wanted to bring a sister on a  what I consider  very early date  I m guessing it s a way for her to have her sister vet me out  I m curious to hear what other people think
Reddit,Should I give this guy a chance ,I matched with a guy a couple months ago and we hit it off on the app  When about   weeks went by  he said he knew I probably thought it was weird that he didn t ask me out  He said he wanted to but was dealing with some things and to  trust  that he d be ready to meet in a couple weeks  I deduced that he was either unemployed or something similar  and I gave him my number and said to reach out when he s ready  We kept chatting  on the app only  and the messages got fewer and further between and his tone sort of changed  I felt like he was losing interest and so was I  I ended up unmatching him         The same day  he texted me because he noticed I unmatched him and he said he was disappointed because he was excited about me  He wanted to make sure I didn t want to keep talking before he deleted my number  I basically said everything I said here to him  I don t want a pen pal and it was weird that he put it off  If it was a financial issue  we could have just met up for coffee or a walk in the park or something  I guess he had also perceived me messaging less as losing interest and assumed I met someone else  Anyway we worked through the miscommunication and then texted for about a week and it was fine  Then he randomly texted me saying something like he didn t want to waste my time because he wasn t in a place to date  I didn t respond  A few days later he apologized for it and said he was in a weird mood that day  I ignored all of these messages         Now a MONTH later  he texts me again  He apologized and said he started a weed business and that s why he was so busy  He said he was sorry for not being honest but and regretted not meeting me and was hoping we can still meet         I am dumbfounded  I do believe he is genuinely interested in me but I can t tell if he s married or texting from prison or something  Something isn t right  Even if it was genuinely a job thing  he just came across as not quite ready to date and I can t imagine the last month changed that  But it s rare to hit it off with someone enough to want to text them for a month and I do think he genuinely likes me  I just don t know if I should just meet him          TLDR  Met on a dating app  chatted on and off for months and he kept putting off meeting  apparently due to being unemployed  Now he s back and I m not sure if it s worth meeting now that he s finally ready

Reddit,Seeing likes without subscription,Is Hinge the only major dating app where you can see your likes and like back without a paid subscription  I get that you can only see one at a time  but better than nothing  The other apps I ve seen so far don t give you any access to view people who like you unless you pay for a subscription  Is Hinge the exception 
Reddit,Asking the same question again ,Someone I ve been chatting to for a few days - the  nd or  rd message was establishing what work we do   They re asking me again what I do for work lol     what does this mean   Do I mention it or just tell them again   I feel kinda sad about this not gunna lie 
Reddit,Regardless of where you are in the convo  if you dont say your not interested or unmatch then your ghosting,Tired of seeing  its only ghosting if you ve met or have planned a date  if you ve began a conversation even if you ve only had one text exchange and you don t say your not interested or unmatch its still ghosting  You can make up whatever arbitrary rules you want to try to justify it but by definition its still ghosting     I appreciate everyones participation especially BastardBroth and Appropriate Tea for their strong participation and detailed arguments  This post got hot pretty quick   
Reddit,Slow fade or Breadcrumbing or  ,So i met someone from OLD about   weeks back  Im only moderately interested in her but figured worth a  nd date  Since then ive come down with Covid  she came down with a sore throat  Ive called or texted her a few times and shes usually really slow to respond  She s told me that she had to pick up extra hours at work because her house needs fixing  About twice a week i will get a text from her telling me that shes not ignoring my call or text but shes grinding at work and putting in lot of OT  Im doing most of the initiating usually a text or two a week   I contacted her Sat we exchanged messages  She sends me pic and says this is why im doing the OT  She then explains that the AC vents leaked water into her walls now she has to put a new wall and there is some mold damage    This has been going on now for almost a month now or thereabouts  At this point i mostly lost interest but she will periodically send me a message for example on Friday  Goodvening Tom  I have been grinding at work      I need work done blah  blah    Im not sure if this is some sort of breadcruming  The last time i exp something like this it went on for  -  weeks only to be told they met someone else

Reddit,Question  Why Can t Women Let Men Take the Gracious L  When it s Obvious it Isn t Working  Why the Excuses ,I can t recall how many times I can tell the convo is stunted  there s a lack of interest  probably matching with someone  better   or whatever - either way  it s obvious - where I ll take the initiative and  genuinely  be kind to them but suggest that their conversation energy comes across as they re not feeling it  not going into any particular reasons  but it s totally fine if the interest isn t mutual  but I wish them luck in what they re looking for   I m always met reasons or excuses  but the result is always along the lines of  I do want to talk to you  sorry it came across that way   only for them to maintain base-level platitudes  to then unmatch once I m either asleep  at work or otherwise busy in the gym etc   Like  I m already acknowledging that I m holding that L and it ain t going to work  Why not just accept it  as opposed to playing the game and wasting both of our time   This has happened so many during my three years of being single  Like  not everyone is compatible  and I m not going to get antagonistic about that  or chastise someone   However  I m starting to wonder if it s a passive aggressive power thing  Is it  Like  getting the last word   Any other guys have this happen 
Reddit,Facebook dating ignoring distance,Anyone else have this issue   I m setting the distance as    miles away from me  and the GPS shows the right city and state  but     of the results are like     to     miles away in states around me   I m matching with so many people but have to end it quick after seeing the distance just isn t going to work

Reddit,Does anyone know what setting on Bumble turns off them changing your photo to your  most popular  photo ,I have noticed Bumble has a feature where it puts your most popular picture as your top picture  but every time I try to change my photo to something else a few hours later when I hop back on the app it tells me it automatically changed it back to the older picture  Is there a setting to turn this off 
Reddit,Set a date on Friday For Sunday  girl unmatches a couple hours before the date  Do you still go to the date ,Like it says in the title  I set a date with a girl on Friday for the  st day I m off which was Sunday she seemed pretty into it and we ve talked quite a bit for the past week  I went on to the app just to confirm we were still on and saw that she had unmatched  Do you still go at the agreed upon time for the agree upon place   Edit   For clarity  this place is about    minutes from both of us on the East Side of town and we are both on the West side  so I didn t want to give her the idea that I was picking a place close to her so we could hook up  It s a cool little cocktail bar that I go to occasionally but it s not a place where i am a regular and i tried to make that clear that its cool but i dont go there often so neither one of us have  home court  advantage  
Reddit,Is it really THAT bad for guys out there ,So I ve been back on a few OLD apps for a couple of months now  I d like to think I scrub up ok and generally not a bad looking guy  I met my previous partner on tinder and had a   year relationship    However  I ve had literally zero matches except bots and scams on Tinder  bumble and hinge   On all I ve paid for short term benefits and got absolutely nowhere   Do you actually have to be an Adonis to get anywhere on these or is there still room for the average fella

Reddit,Why no matches on Hinge ,I have been on   major apps  Facebook dating  etc     and probably get between   and    likes per week on each leading to at least   or   quality matches weekly  per site   Someone I know recommended Hinge and using the same photos  I have not received one single like in   days   Is there something wrong with Hinge  or do you have to pay to get any traction 
Reddit,FB Dating Distances,I ve used FB dating since    at least a year now  Pretty good experience generally  And for whatever reason  for the last  say    weeks  the app seems to not care about my distance preferences  I live in Atlanta  but I LITERALLY get suggestions of girls in QUEBEC  TORONTO  North Carolina  Florida  Texas    places that are very very far from my specified distance preferences  naturally   and the issue persists even when I turn off the  lucky pick  thingy  which used to be the fix for this   Is this anyone else s experience  or is it just me  I know there s always error with the distance suggestions  but this level of error is unacceptable
Reddit,I don t want to give out my number to everyone who asks on these apps anymore  Ladies  how do you feel about it ,If I m being honest with myself  for a while now  I ve given my number to most guys on these apps who asked for it or offer theirs first  and have never felt very comfortable doing that  It just feels weird to text a stranger  Now I think it may be time to set a boundary  Recently  a guy asked if I was alright with texting off the app and we d been talking for a couple days  and I just asked  would it be okay if we just keep talking on here for now   And he said  that s totally fine  not a problem at all   And I just felt better  I don t think I want to give a guy my number until we meet  or at least have set up a date  This one other guy and I exchanged one or two messages to each other before he asked for my number  What is the hurry  Is it weird that now I want to say to them  if you don t mind  I d like to just keep talking on here until we meet at least   Set a boundary  That s something I have to get more comfortable with  And if they don t like it  I probably don t want them anyway

Reddit,What apps are yielding most options for people who want to date and find potential relationships ,Bonus points if anyone has apps for people that value spirituality   Anyways I m  f    on hinge and I feel I get few likes and even fewer reciprocity when I send likes   Compared to      and       since last year barely got proper matches that made past   date  whereas I had success in being pursued almost every  -  months in      and      every time I got back      Since my looks may be something people will want to assess in analyzing my success  I m no insta model kind  but I get told I m really cute or pretty a good amount   I m south Asian  and I do believe race is a part of success that s been well researched but isn t acknowledged as much here on Reddit      Anyways it seems that apps have been declining in the past couple years   But just thought I d get some suggestions for apps producing higher rates so that I may try them 
Reddit,Girls  do you use bikini pictures to weed out the thirsty boys ,If a guy likes one of your bikini photos  would you match with him   Or do you use that as a signal that he just wants sex   I    M  seem to have better results when I like one of her more modest photos    is this a strategy that girls are using   This question only applies to Hinge or FB Dating where you can send a comment with your like

Reddit,Which dating app besides Tinder ,I m reluctant to use Tinder again  please share personally tried phone apps for finding FwB that work for you   A little ranty background  I have just asked my coworker if she wanted to hookup  the answer was no  I am happy I asked  because you never know until you ask  But now I know  and with that being said  I have pretty much exhausted my social circle options for women interested in being FwB  So now I have to try my luck at online dating     Why not Tinder  I have used Tinder about   months ago  and it was a disappointing experience  I am both good looking and can hold interesting conversations  but I barely got any matches  and if I did get a rare match  I would get a no reply to my conversation starter  Rinse and repeat  I did not understood the concept of  matching  if you actually don t plan to chat with that person to find out if you vibe or not  Are girls just expecting some crazy fun conversation starters and don t reply to casual non-intrusive ones     x   B     x   B 
Reddit,What s the best way to say you don t drink or smoke ,A  Say in bio Non drinker Non smoker B  Say in bio  Sober  C  Fill out lifestyle prompts about drinking smoking but don t mention it in the bio D  Don t mention it at all   I feel like the word sober sounds less pretentious than A  But people that describe themselves as sober from my experience used to drink smoke excessively but don t anymore due to past addiction  I personally never have drank or smoked  Not sure if it matters but I don t want to present myself falsely  I m    to give you an idea of my dating pool 
Reddit,Has anyone ran into Potential matches that recognized you off of a dating app ,I work for a pretty large hospital and I m decently active on bumble hinge tinder    Someone I sent a message to on hinge recognized me while at work and made some off hand comments to their friend  I recognized them and overheard their conversation while they were giggling and pointing at me    Like literally pointing while in our Hospital s caf     A few of my co workers asked about it and all and all it felt very  high school   Has anyone ran into people who recognized you off the apps 
Reddit,Dating App Etiquette  What to Do if Something Feels a Little Sus ,I matched with someone on a dating app yesterday and something feels a little   off   about our conversation   I m wondering if there s anything that I can say that will be respectful if they are who they say they are  but can also help me get a better sense of whether this is a catfish situation   Ex  They claim to have owned    Anatomy Optimized LLC  a cash based PT clinic near Main St   in the small town where I grew up  I m wondering if this person just Googled me and made up the business        Business Record    I don t see a record of this business in this location  though this business name shows up in other states  If it was  cash based   maybe that could explain it        Main Street    To my knowledge  there isn t a street called  Main Street  in the town  There is a main road that goes through the town  and it becomes  Main St  once you cross into the next town  If you owned a business you  would remember the name of the main road in the town  right  If you were faking and didn t want to look at a map   Main Street  would normally be a good guess     If you connected with someone and found out that you both lived worked in the same small town in a completely different part of the country    wouldn t you be more specific about where the business was  or say other defining things about the town    Ex   Our office was next to the red brick church and we used to eat lunch across the street at Schroder s Deli etc   I asked if they were referring to  Main St  in this specific town     They wrote    Ya   What s the place you work called        I never told them if I worked or what field I was in    so I thought this was a strange segue    Thanks 
Reddit,I chase a guy   he seems interested but it didn t end well,Me     F   met this guy      M   from OLD   The first date went pretty great and I like him a lot but he didn t follow up on second date and when I text him   he keep turning the conversation sexual so I gave up on it  On our first date   he did mentioned he is looking for a relationship and he ask whats my criteria  Just he wasn t shy away from sex topic  The following month I randomly hit him up to ask him for sex  The sex is amazing  We talk a lot and he also tell me I am pretty  We also cuddle watching tv after sex  Great sex and Great Conversation  I told him I like him a lot and why didn t he hit me up again  He said he prefer a girl to do the chasing  I can tell he is a tad insecure because sometimes he speak and I didn t hear it clearly and then he was telling me how his bad teeth cause his speech to be blurred  He also apologized for walking with a limp because of his leg injury  Then he also ask me if I can cook   he have a mother who can t cook and it sucks     All signs point to it have the potential of being serious  He even hold my hand  The thing is I have to wait A MONTH for the second date to have sex  We would text here and there and only when I initiate  I hate waiting for a month but I figure its ok since he is responsive to message  although less texts than what I prefer  I figured since he prefer a girl who chase him so I might as well chase him  I don t mind  He also went to fixed his teeth and get braces during this time  Second Date he seems really great and even said he missed me  He even bought a vibrator just to make sure I get off  We talked about his teeth   I said it doesn t bother me with the garbled speech and the snoring because of the teeth  He said     it doesn t bother you but you sure will complain later    I also ask him   When he is becoming me my boyfriend   while we are doing missionary  He seems pretty taken aback and said  well I am here already    After that his texting is like way off  He would go days without texting me unless I text a couple of follow-ups  But he still go out with me once  I drive him to a place and he seems to hate my driving  He is polite about it and tell me I shouldn t drive like that etc  After that I ask him to go to a movie with me and he said he would let me know  Texting is still way off and he keep wouldn t give me a definite time  I ask to have sex again and he seems excited but still taking a long time to reply as usual even when I send some sexy texts   He taking a long time to get back to me about plans but I saw his instagram   he is definitely out and about  It doesn t seems like he have a girlfriend but he does follow a lot of Red Pill page like Hamza and all those about how to be masculine page  My friend and my mum said I shouldn t keep going out with him and my friend is all about the guy initiating most of the time   A guy who is serious in pursuing you won t let you drive them   Also when we go out   this guy always went ahead and pay  no hestitation but I always pay him back half  Either way   I sent one last text to this guy and now just ignore him completely   I am always been empathetic towards men   willing to show them I care  go dutch  ask them out sometimes and text first    I am not the   if you don t pay for my meal or buy me this and that   then you are screwed kind of a girl  Basically I give a lot of leeway towards guy since yeah it can get pretty tiring if you are always the one initiating  I think we shouldn t judge how much a guy care based on how much money they willing to spent on you  There is a lot of ways for a guy to show that he cares   But stuff happens and things change  I change as well  maybe what my mum and my friend are right about this  I used to automatically go and pay my share of the bill on the first date  Now I don t see the point anymore because meh does it matter since they always ghost me   If you gonna ghost me then I will let you pay for the first date  If you want me to pay  then you will have to ask me out for the next date  Anyway   I am done doing all the work    In this case I described   the guy definitely show signs that he is interested  they say sometimes texting is not an indicator of interest  I would like to believe that but I think if I don t like something and my gut feels off then I should listen to my guts and stop making excuse for him  I am not sure what scared him off  Maybe I am too pushy   Maybe u guys can help me shed some light on this     months later   I met a guy      M   way older than I normally would go out with  Its honestly so much better  He text me good morning every   days  One time he didn t text me good morning and its been   days   I call him up on it and said I am sad he didn t text me good morning  He told me don t be sad and now his morning text frequency is back to the usual  He also earn way more  I let him pay for the first date  His texting still way less than my liking     -  messages per day and few hours in between but he replied every single time when he sees it     So moral of the lesson  don t make excuse for a guy  You should be chase however  you want it to be   If he don t chase you like you want to  call him out on it in a nice way and see if his behaviour change or else drop him

Reddit,I totally overreacted  now what ,Me  F    Him  M     Went on   dates with a guy I met from an app    I texted him to make a plan for our  th date but he didn t respond for over a day   I texted him at   am on Friday  he didn t text me until     pm on Saturday   I assumed he was trying to ghost me or pull a  slow fade   because it s happened to me before   Before he finally texted me back  I figured I would just forget him and move on  Again  I thought it was a ghosting situation so I deleted his match on the dating app and unfollowed him on IG  assuming I d never hear from him again   But I was wrong  And we ended up meeting for another date  He asked me about it  not accusing me  but he was curious about what happened  Initially  I tried to cover it up  but then I told him I was upset and confused that I didn t hear from him  And I admitted I was being overdramatic  He said he was sorry and that he wouldn t let it happen again   I have anxious attachment issues so this was a defense mechanism and a protest behavior  I ve been hurt a lot before and I  totally overreacted    I guess things are okay now  we talked it out  But I just keep thinking about it  And am worried I may have self-sabotaged  What  if anything  should I do from here

Reddit,How quickly do you respond when you get a message ,I ve been trying to wrap my head around the idea of how fast to respond to messages  I m a guy and I find women tend to be slow to respond  From times I have asked  it seems most turn off notifications from dating apps  so they respond when they open the app to check    I don t have notifications disabled  If I m sitting watching TV and get a message  my phone will light up  So I find myself wondering whether to respond immediately or not  It seems stupid to play games and not respond considering I m free right now but at the same time  does responding too fast give off bad vibes when the other person is taking a few hours between each message   What s the best way to handle the situation where you await the response and jump at it  Is it best to wait a while

Reddit,Y all remember that old Windows screensaver   D Maze ,That s what online dating is to me     Same dead end convos over and over until one party loses interest and stops responding because they ve seemingly found a better dopamine hit from a new match  until you finally reach the point of exchanging numbers and a spark and you go on a date and then they ghost you or text saying they re not ready for anything and it s back to square one    Oh how I wish I could just meet someone organically

Reddit,Doxxed on Are We Dating the Same Guy FaceBook Group,I went on two dates with a lady  let s call her Mary  approximately   years ago in      when I was single   First date  she overshared with me that her dad had murdered her mom  but was acquitted  etc  etc   I was literally like WTF   I started to ghost her  but she was persistent   For some reason  I went on a second date to give it another chance   This time she set expectations that all her previous dates   boyfriends just used her for sex but this time around she was playing for keeps and wasn t going to give up the goods until she was in a committed relationship  etc  etc   We went back to her place  made out  made our way to her bed  took all our clothes off  but she said she didn t want to have sex   No sex happened   She lived about     hours away  I didn t want a long term relationship with her  and didn t feel like playing games  so I just kind of faded away and stopped answering her calls and returning her texts     Fast forward a bit     I met my now wife in mid-     and we married in fall-         Mary sent me a text a few months ago to tell me she was moving to my city to be closer to a guy she s been dating for   years now   Said he was divorced and had   kids but was ready for commitment  blah  blah  blah   I didn t reply to her text because I m married and could care less about someone I met twice four years ago   A few months go by and she texts again  asking about pet sitters  so I told her I usually find teens in my neighborhood that are good with animals and I wished her well in her new city  home  relationship     Apparently this woman has been a Facebook friend  i e   lurker  stalker  for the last   years and I didn t realize it   I don t use FaceBook but my wife and family are on it    If Mary had been paying any attention for the last  -  years to my FaceBook activity  she d have seen the very few posts a few times per year with my wife  children  each of us tagging each other in our posts wishing happy birthday  happy anniversary  etc  etc   She even would have seen my relationship status which says - married to xxxxxx   Today  she contacted me again and asked if I was married   I said yes I am  hoping she will get the hint and buzz off for good this time   Moments later  I begin getting texts from friends saying I ve been doxxed on the Are We Dating the Same Guy FaceBook group   Needless to say  my wife s girlfriends began reaching out to her about the same time   Apparently Mary said we went on a date a  couple of years ago  which would correspond to Fall        Someone else on the group claims we went out  in the past    Needless to say  my wife is loosing her shit and accusing me of cheating now  but this all happened before COVID and before her and I met     I checked and this group wasn t created until June      and I think it s very pathetic that women are giving critiques from what they recall from   years ago and doxxing me because shit didn t work out   I really feel this group is just spewing hate and not for any good and well intentioned purpose except for character disordered people to try to exact revenge    Thoughts     x   B 
Reddit,Ladies  how likely are you to respond to texts without a question in it ,I ve noticed that sometimes I ll get a lengthy text with no question in it  Which means I have to come up with another question to ask  However  whenever I send a text without a question in it  the chances that the person responds is a lot lower  Now I don t mind driving the conversation but it seems a little weird  So I m curious if this is true and if so  why that is   Edit  I m talking about several messages into the conversation

Reddit,facebook dating daily limit,Ok im honestly searching this for the past hour and I can t get a reliable source that can confirm the exact number of  swipes  I can do per day  I just joined yesterday  and i dont know when it will reset  There is no indication for anything  Not even facebook Q A has that information    I guess I should start being really picky  which is honestly better for everyone to avoid the extreme spam  but still  it s a really amateur move by a huge company like fb  to not inform you in an obvious way of your limitation  I hope I m wrong and that there is somewhere a specific limit number     edit  that s the  limit  screen for me  https   imgur com a xFCHuJK  https   imgur com a xFCHuJK     UPDATE     So  there are two options  the one is straight up dating  and there is a second tab under  friendship   in my understanding they both serve they same purpose  flirting   I mixed and matched both of them  These are my statistics from tonight   In  dating   heart   I swiped Right  liked         and I swiped Left  rejected           In  friendship  tab  smile   I swiped Right  liked         and I swiped Left  rejected           I wasn t extremely picky  especially in the friendship option  since it might serve for just casual chat  it s not like I m desperate for sex  I m just curious about facebook dating app  Hopefully in my place I didn t encounter any super obvious bot  but I avoided the ones with limited info photos     Since the overall number of both  left right  swipes makes no sense         the limit seems to be     likes  in either  dating  or  friendship   per day  it unlocked about the same time I started yesterday    Anyway that s what I got  I hope someone who googles that  find this post helpful  It s better to be a bit picky      per day is a decent number  unless someone wants to go on a random swipe spree  many of us have done that in the past    Thank you all  good luck in your love adventures

Reddit,How can I do online dating without the dopamine hit or getting addicted,  M  Just to clarify I don t do OLD for an ego boost  I would genuinely like a relationship  It just seems that the dopamine hit of the app gets to me  and I get burnt out within   weeks  Is there any advice for doing this longish term  at least a month   I always make an app  the app sucks me in  and then I have to delete or else my head hurts

Reddit,Are Facebook crushes completely random ,So  for context  I am a gay man  I recently decided to try out Facebook dating  and once in a while Facebook offers me the option to send  crushes  to people I know  One of the people that came up today  I know but if he is gay or bi  I had no idea  Is it just suggesting any guy from my friends list or are these people actually gay or bi before that option comes up  because that s kind of cruel to both parties if they re showing straight guys to gay men  since both parties may get false hope of something 
Reddit,Why do some men act like women are a video game  Where if you input a certain code it unlocks a girlfriend,I always see this on dating subreddits where there s how-to guides of things you can do to get a woman interested in you   Also guides on how to escalate and build sexual tension   Are these men oblivious that women have their own agency as well   Every time a guy writes in about being rejected  other guys say  oh bro you should have done xyz instead    But maybe she just didn t like him like that was all 
Reddit,I probably shouldn t have matched with another guy days after the first date,Context   I    F  matched with  let s call him  Aaron    M   Few days of chatting we and seemed to match in terms of goals and ideals  so we agreed to meet up in person on the weekend  The whole week before the date  we could chat for hours till bedtime  But after the date  there was complete silence  I texted him after   days of silence and his reply was    a skull emoji     Ok  So he s not interested   I thought to myself  Kinda pissed  I spent a lot on the date but ok  Time to fish for the next guy  Here  I matched with  let s call him  Bob    M    The next day  Aaron explained it s because he s on a cut  diet  and under anti-depressant so he s been easily irritated lately  There wasn t much chat exchange  I gave him the benefit of doubt  meanwhile  Bob and I are getting along great so far   Two days later  Aaron asked  sup    Not much exchange again  not like the chats we had before the date  I m already losing interest with him  Bob and I are already planning on a date this weekend   The next day  is the same  but this time  he  Aaron  asked me to hang out tomorrow  I was hesitant and indecisive  The first reason is I didn t have money anymore and didn t like feeling like I owe someone something by paying for me   Second is coz I thought he wasn t interested anymore  So I told him  Then he said he s cover the payment  Then he texted to make up my mind fast coz he s on a cut  diet  and kinda impatient  So I said no  coz wtf right    Later he explained that he s not usually like that  it s coz of the cut   Next day  he chatted again  Saying he was bored tonight  That made me feel like he s just using me to pass the time    and I do not know how to avoid him    I tried the soft ghosting technique but I m naturally talkative in chat so I kinda failed on that one    BUT he is chatting more than in the past few days  However  Bob and I are getting along waaaay too well already at this point   Same day  night time  Aaron showed me his pet cats  My weakness    Next day  Bob also showed his cat pic  They re all so cute   Next day  today   Bob and I now have a more concrete plan for a date  I m going to my home town tomorrow night  so we planned to meet before I go  That night  Aaron also asked to hang out again  I told him no coz I m going home tomorrow  I didnt tell him about Bob  Now I kinda feel guilty coz idk if Aaron is genuine or not  even tho I already don t want him anymore but I m still thinking he s only like that coz of the cut   List of fears  Bob might turn out to be like Aaron  Aaron might be only talking to me coz he doesn t have any other match on the dating app  Maybe it s me who s the problem   I ve never been on dates relationships before  This is all new    Edit  The jury has spoken  Aaron got the thumbs down  Thank you everyone

Reddit,Effect of online validation on humans,I believe i have never seen sufficient material on what effect validation has on humans  and i mean all humans  but trying to be rational about it  it s nothing good   i try to imagine the effect it has on me  and sometimes i even get to experience it  and it feels good  like a drug  then i realize i get the desire to become pickier  to treat others with less respect  and to quantify women s value and ignore or downprioritize those with apparent less value  value assessment also changes  and i feel look becomes more important and i also get fooled more easily by makeup  clothings  and other mainstream superficial aspects like that  whereas in absence of validation it is easier to see straight  recognize red flags  and simply look for the right aspects   thoughts

Reddit,Question about boo,While checking my account  I noticed that I had    loves   even though I ve only matched with one person so far that I know of and I haven t posted anything on the  Home -tab   The Boo FAQ reads that you get love from being active in the community or by being a good person  What does this mean exactly as it seems pretty vague to me  Do I have   matches that I don t know of or did I earn  Love  by doing something else

Reddit,Maybe online dating just isn t for me,At least it isn t for me right now  I thought getting bumble would help me find someone  I hear stories of people finding someone awesome and it gives me hope  As a very anxious person who is also an introvert  it s actually somehow more terrifying than irl conversations    I ve been on bumble for more than a year now  But I m very inconsistent  I keep giving up and hating it  But after a while  I ll be back thinking I should give it another try  It always ends the same  with me despising it and feeling emotionally drained  It feels shallow  I hate judging people based on so little information  And it makes me feel like absolutely crap when I compare myself to other women who get way more matches   Nothing motivates me more to get out of the house than how awful dating apps are    I m only in my early   s  I d much rather get to know people irl and see where it goes  rather than trying dating apps  It s that stupid FOMO of seeing happy couples my age who met through OLD     apologies for any typos mistakes  It s late  I m sleepy and annoyed typing this on my phone

Reddit,Introverted people  are you doing well with online dating ,I wanted to ask the introverted people around here if dating apps have been a good choice for them  I feel like it is too overwhelming and it takes too much time to get to know someone  and it could lead to nothing  It takes lots and lots of texting  talking and meeting  which is emotionally draining  And even if I meet a person  who I think could be someone special  they just don t understand that I need more time to get comfortable   
Reddit,Is it rude to unmatch people you haven t met or made plans to meet ,I just remade my Hinge about   weeks ago  I recently got a like from someone I d matched with several months ago and he left me a note about how I was trash  literally put a trash can emoji  for unmatching him  without reason     The thing is  I remember his face and we only talked for maybe a day or two  Our personalities weren t meshing well and he was becoming clingy very fast so I just unmatched and removed myself from the convo  I didn t think it was a big deal cause we hadn t spoken long  hadn t met in public and didn t have any plans to meet as is    Now I m wondering if I should be letting every single person know that I plan on unmatching  The only time I felt it was necessary to give reason is if we ve met in person and it didn t go well or has been speaking for several days    I am   F btw  Just wondering everyones thoughts on unmatching etiquette

Reddit,Anyone else only OLD ,I  M    work sort of a weird schedule and sort of socially awkward  like seemingly so many now  and really only OLD out of convince but its getting discouraging  I d like to meet someone a little more organically  but I wouldn t even really know how or where anymore  Not super into bars or anything  Might try different meet up groups  Anyone else in a similar boat 
Reddit,Anything I could have done better  - polite rejection after   good dates,So I    M  matched with a   F back in mid September around  -  weeks ago and the conversation was going really well  we had similar values personality also childfree and introvert  and interests and I proposed that we meet up a few days later  However  as she was busy with other stuff we agreed on a date   weeks later  She wasn t a frequent texter which I didn t mind as I prefer this over lovebombing and then ghosting which I had experienced in the past   We ended up meeting at a cafe  she hugged me at the beginning and then we had a good and interesting conversation on many topics whilst walking along the river  The date lasted for   hours  At the end when we parted our ways we hugged again and said that I had a good time and would be open to meeting up  Later in the evening I sent a follow up message thanking for a nice afternoon walk and conversation and said I d be open to meeting up again and communicating on other platforms   She responded with her number and a few days later we agreed to meet again at a museum  it was her preferred option as she wanted to see some art    weeks later in the early afternoon  The museum was quite busy but still had some good conversations on art and lots of stuff in general  Obviously there were no circumstances to make it more intimate romantic due to the busyness of the place  however I still enjoyed it  Then when we said goodbyes  she had something planned for later so couldn t continue  and she said that she would message me which she did  In the next morning she said that she really liked me as a friend and would like to stay in touch but can t see the  romantic connection between us   which partially surprised me as she seemed to be a kind of person who likes take things slowly   Anyway  I thanked her for the honesty and said that I would be open to meet as friends at some point in the future  I have no hard feelings just slight disappointment as compared to other girls I ve been on dates this year I could see a much higher degree of compatibility   Personally  if I don t see any physical potential  attraction  to develop something romantic I end up things after the first date but here I presume this must have been something that happened before the second date or just during it  Any ideas  Now  I just think that museum alone wasn t really a good idea for a second date which could have had an impact on her lack of interest 
Reddit,Navigating the uncertainty  Is she really into me ,I ve been dating a girl for approximately a month now  and the initial phase was quite smooth  Our first date was fantastic  we had an engaging conversation and discovered numerous shared interests  Both of us took the initiative to plan additional dates  which included various enjoyable activities   As we continue dating  I ve observed that she seldom asks questions  She can talk about herself for hours and occasionally throw in a question or two  I try to be engaged and ask questions and follow-up to get to know her better  but it seems like she s not very curious about me as a person   Moreover  during periods when we re not meeting in person  I ve noticed a lack of communication in our text messages aswell  I ve tried initiating conversations about our days and emotions  but our text exchanges tend to fizzle out rather quickly  Although I believe it might not be a significant issue since we can still use texting to coordinate future dates  the complete silence between our in-person meetings has started to feel infuriating  I constantly wrestle with the urge to send a message asking about her activities and thoughts  but I m beginning to feel it might be burdensome  potentially bothering her  What adds to the confusion is her quick response when she eventually does reply  and her ability to share extensive details about her day  However  she still refrains from asking questions in our text conversations    It s perplexing because she still seems interested in dating me  She has invited me to meet her friends  and she wants to talk on the phone during busy weekends to stay connected  I find it emotionally draining and challenging to determine whether her interest is genuine or if dating serves as a means of seeking validation and recognition  She has mentioned feeling unheard and undervalued in her past relationships  and it appears that she may be projecting these past experiences onto our current situation  possibly without realizing it   I m contemplating discussing this with her  but I m uncertain if it s too early or if it s worth the effort  I m also considering whether it might be better to move on and let go  What would you do in my situation 
Reddit,Just need to vent about this bad date I had tonight,So I    F  meet this guy    M  at a bar nearby my place  First date for me in a year   First off  he was shorter than what he had said  and he had gained weight  He showed up in sweat pants  looking like he has just gotten out of bed     Still the date starts out fairly good  we have some things to talk about  the conversation is going smoothly even though I am carrying a lot of it      At some point I ask him about his experience with online dating  he gives me a vague answer  But then I say  to be fair kind of an unfortunate comment  that my experience has been neither really great nor really bad  just didn t feel a connection most of the time  I think this comment upset him because then there was definite mood shift  He said then that he was meeting nice but boring people  which felt like a dig at me      We were talking about different places in the neighborhood and he kept saying   it would be a great place for your next date     At least   times he said that     There were big gaps in the conversation  I was waiting to see if he would ask a question  and he never did  It was very awkward  At this point it turned confrontational  we couldn t even agree on the weather      He then said   ok  I m gonna dip    Wish I said that first lol    At the beginning he had put his card down even though I said second round on me  Now he was upset to pay  He asked if I had venmo  I said no  He sighed and said ok I ll pay      When we parted ways we didn t even stop  we just kept on walking in different directions

Reddit,she showed up completely wasted,I     M  matched with a    F  on Bumble about   weeks ago  We got off the app  exchanged phone numbers  had a phone call  and a few texts  I asked her on date which was last night  She showed up completely drunk  slurring her words  eyes bloodshot  stumbling around  etc   She hardly said a word  and in all honesty I did not feel like having a conversation with her  We ordered our meals and ate and split the bill  I did not walk her to her car  in fact after dinner she said she had to go to the bathroom and never came back  I left the restaurant to find her in the parking lot puking  and asked her if she wants me to order her an Uber to which she said  no I walked here   okay fine  I left  What would you have done in this situation  My friends told me I should have just left and not ordered dinner  Was I too nice to stick around for   hours wasting my time with someone who was lights on but nobody home 
Reddit,Is my height the problem ,I m a guy in my mid   s         This is kind of a crappy height cause I m worried girls think I m lying about it    With that said though  even if girls believe this is it at all possible for a good looking and interesting  I m not claiming to be either  to get a decent number of matches on hinge tinder bumble   In real life I do much better with women  even getting approached by taller women in certain contexts    Do I need to start paying for premium subscriptions or is the reality that being under   feet  no matter how attractive  going to be an uphill battle 
Reddit,Funny how everyone tries to use their best photos on dating apps yet I m far more attracted to people IRL,Obviously there s quite a difference between pixels on a screen and flesh and blood but I think everyone s attempt to use their best photos can backfire as they tend to feel homogenous and lack that understated everyday beauty of people you walk past in say the grocery store who aren t wearing a plastic smile with their head tilted at the angle they think makes their chin look most defined with their stomach sucked in and chest pushed out etc   Maybe I ve become jaded with the sea of similar profiles but I m rarely very attracted to anyone I see online anymore yet when I take a trip to my local shops I ll be mesmerised by at least   or   ladies - ones who I can tell I would swipe left on if I saw them online    It s like the opposite of the typical issue where guys complain women look so much better online than offline   I ve been making an effort to chat to women I see our and about for this reason - it s about the only chance I ve got it meeting someone I m actually attracted to it seems   Does Anyone feel me 
Reddit,I don t want to give my real number to someone online ,What I can I do  I don t want them to be like you have an iPhone but are green   I just don t feel comfortable giving them the actual one  Especially since it carries so much info  I can give insta but that s another app too

Reddit,Hinge is a Scam ,I just finished a month of paid membership   If I was shown anyone at all  they were overweight and unattractive   With my dealbreakers in place  I went TWO WEEKS without a single standout   I have complained about this in multiples posts previously on this and other threads   So  today is the first day of not being a paid member  the plan was to delete and forget this experience altogether   Today  my que is full of attractive women  both standouts and discovery   endless amounts of single women just appeared apparently   Two of which live in my neighborhood   Literally like     yards from me   Did they just join today   Of course not   The app has obviously been withholding these profiles during my membership  they already had my money so to hell with me  and now they want more so they are actually showing matches  nearby  that are looking for the same things as me  and I match their preferences according to the  compatible  tab   These people should be sued into oblivion   What a bunch of scammers 
Reddit,Which apps to use ,Getting back into OLD after being out of the game for a while  Some friends have told me that different apps serve different purposes   Specifically   Tinder is for hookups  Hinge is for relationships  Bumble is a bit of both   Is this right  I m wondering if this is specific to my area or if it s trend in general   Or if my friends are full of shit

Reddit,Should I dump someone over not wishing me a happy birthday ,I ve    F  been dating a guy    M  for about a month now  Met on bumble  We have been out on   dates so far  I m really enjoying hanging out with him and we have a great connection  We text everyday  But to be honest  I m sorta bothered by the fact that he didn t wish me a happy birthday  I told him several times leading up to the big day that I was going to be celebrating my birthday that weekend  On the day of my birthday  he didn t reach out to say happy birthday  We talked about other things instead  I was definitely not expecting him to take me out for my birthday or get me a gift  we haven t been dating that long  but the fact that he didn t even send me a happy birthday text is kind of off putting to me  Normally I would say that maybe he just forgot the day of my birthday  but I talked about it with him several times  I just don t think there s any way he would ve forgotten if he was actually into me     I know a lot of people don t care about or celebrate their birthday  so it s possible that he didn t say happy birthday to me for that reason   But  I have always liked birthdays and I don t need to do a big celebration every year  but I like to do at least a little something nice on my birthday  And I don t at all expect gifts from friends and family  but I do really appreciate hearing from them wishing me a happy birthday on the actual day  even if they just send a text or give me a call  In the past  I ve had guys I ve only dated for a bit reach out and say happy birthday  and some have even taken me out or have gotten me gifts    It sounds crazy but I feel like I m taking him not wishing me happy birthday as a sign he s not into me  and that he s just stringing me along    How do I talk to him about this without coming off as needy  Is it even worth talking about  Should I just take this as a sign he isn t into me and move on  Open to suggestions  Thank you     TLDR  Should I dump a guy I just started dating because he didn t wish me happy birthday 
Reddit,Facebook Dating Distance,Male      I am not even sure why Facebook has a distance filter   No matter what I get people     miles away  I have the filter set to   miles just to see if that helps  I wonder if FB has a different understanding of what a mile is   I thought maybe Kilometer but that would not work out mathematically either

Reddit,Confusing Situation,I   m matched with a   f  We talked for a bit on the app and the switched over to texting and snap    We talked for a bit on there and talked about a date for the following weekend  She said she wouldn t know until later after work schedule was released  After that texting stopped completley  We then snapped throughout the day but rarely held a conversation    By now even that s fairly non existent  I ve pretty much lost interest but we still snap a bit mainly at night before going to bed    Like I said I ve pretty much done with her due to the lack of conversation  However can someone please explain why she still snaps  Or only snaps right before going to bed    At this point I m just lost as im why do it 
Reddit,Last night s Tinder date ,Hello  friends  I   m  had a wonderful Tinder date last night with a lovely lady   f   It was a last-minute spontaneous adventure by nearly midnight  I bought us a pint of ice cream that we shared  and we just talked in my car    After the ice cream  we walked down by the water  We kept the conversation going as we sat and watched the water  We sat there for maybe another    minutes  and we realized it was really late  Right as I started to get up  I turned around and gave her a kiss    I feel like she was okay with it  She kept it going  but I can t say for sure  After I got back home  I texted her that I got back safe  and she said that she had a good time    That brings us to today  She barely texted back  and I don t know if it s just my anxiety playing games or if she s slowly distancing herself from me now   What do I do next 
Reddit,Do men over estimate women want to see photos of them at the gym or topless ,This is a bit of a two part question    I have no need to see images of men at the gym or topless  i can tell if someone is fit without those images  how do other women feel    Men do you do this because you think women like this  You look good in them 
Reddit,Has anyone gotten blocked by a Tinder dating app match for not replying fast enough   ,I cannot tell you how many times I have has this issue  where  on Tinder and other apps  if I don t respond within one hour  like today when I went to the gym and left my phone at home  the girl I matched with either gets A  really petty in our conversation and or B  straight up blocks me and unmatches with me   It s actually ridiculous  because usually a pretty good conversation was going on before this happened  I understand that maybe a heads up that I won t reply for a bit would be ideal  but is it really necessary for a   hour pause in responding    
Reddit,Do I need a paid membership now ,I ve    M  just rejoined a couple apps  Hinge and Bumble  after taking a few years off  In the past I ve always had enough success with matches and initial communication leading to a date  etc  Please don t mistake that for ego  I just mean it s been a reasonably good experience for me    Fast forward to the past couple months and I m literally getting zero matches or responses on either app  If anything I m in even better physical and overall life shape than I was a few years ago  so it s not an  I ve let myself go  situation    One thing I ve noticed is the apps are pushing paid membership far more than they used to  They also pretty explicitly state you get higher priority and more prominence with a paid membership  Can anyone weigh in about this  Is that really true  and could my being non-paying member be a major contributor to my lack of connections this time around 
Reddit,Can anyone recommend a good dating app that doesn t paywall everything ,Tried Bumble but it feels like everything is paywalled  it kept telling me someone had  swiped right  on me but wouldn t let me see who unless I paid up  Nothing on the Play Store is striking much confidence to me  either   Not helping is the fact that I have never been on a date before in my life in the first place and wrestle with major social anxiety 
Reddit,Navigating the  what are you looking for   question without sounding like a trollop ,After many serious relationships  including a marriage  I m    F  ready to find something new  But my  pitch  feels like too much  or too non traditional  or maybe even like I m  just looking for sex   I don t know how to convey what I want  or when to convey it  I always come off like I m drawing up a contract for them to sign    Basically    I ve sat with the question of  what do I want  for a while  and the most honest truth is that I m NOT looking for another serious relationship  but I m NOT looking for casual hookups with different men    I want - essentially - to be a part time girlfriend lol    Yes  I really want a sexual partner  but I don t want just sex  I want to see the same person  -  times a month  and do all the normal stuff  the restaurants and couch movies and sleepovers  The relaxed comfortability of super intimate sex and feeling open and honest and unafraid around someone  Being able to say  can you hold me for five minutes   Being able to share our feelings and thoughts    But both being content to go back to our own lives  our jobs and children  and see each other again in another  -  days    And not having the traditional anxiety of  if we snuggle after sex  does that mean we re getting serious  If we go on real dates  does that mean we re serious  If we do this for x months it means we have to go to a next level    And avoiding the traditional anxiety  jealousy  and game-playing that comes with withholding your feelings  playing everything cool  and trying to perform based on a pre-determined  label   I guess I m looking for FWB but that label comes with a ton of connotations that I don t agree with  Like my friends say  but what if one of of you CATCHES FEEEELINGS  and I swear I want to murder whoever coined that phrase  FEELINGS are awesome  They make sex     xs better  There s nothing wrong with feeling a connection  Can t we sidestep all the bad stuff by just being open about what exactly we are looking for and what we can  give    Anyway  tl dr  am I looking for a unicorn  Do I sound like I m just looking for sex  Should I limit my matches to men who also have kids  since they re more likely to understand     Idk what s up with the younger gen  but I get asked out by    year olds a lot and they seem like a good fit for this  but also maybe not mature enough     
Reddit,OkC - Pointless likes,Why do profiles of people  whom I have messaged but who ve obviously not liked back or replied  keep showing up in my Likes section     Is it meant to be kinda like a daily reminder of my failures   Lol  What the fxck am I supposed to do with them      There s nothing I can do to make them go away   other than blocking those profiles - utterly  pointless     OkCupid   just a bunch of effin  c nts at this point    end of rant 
Reddit,Too many dates,Hi   So  I ve done some online dating on and off over the last several years  I never had much success because I had terrible photos and I couldn t stomach the dating apps much   However  after a year in the gym and some good photos  I find myself having much more success  Unexpected success  Without thinking about it  I ve followed every thread and it led to a bit too many dates   I had two last week  I have three this week  And two that are up in the air for the weekend next week   The amount of time and energy it takes is one thing  but that I can manage  But what I m realizing is that it s really hard to focus on how I m feeling about one person in particular while having so many options floating in the air    In my head  I would just have a lot of first dates and know easily which ones I wanted to go on a second date  But now I find myself having had two first dates that were by all means good dates  No huge spark but no reason not to see them again  And with all the other dates coming  I feel like it will be massively confusing emotionally   For those that have learned this lesson in the past  how do you manage it  Do you get a few match then turn off the apps until you manage it  How do you analyze your own interest and make choices 
Reddit,Cannot wrap my head around recent success rate,I was last on OLD apps in my late-  s  and it was a slow drip-drip of first dates  maybe once every two months or so  with few matches  and fewer conversions to actual dates   I was in an LTR in my early   s  which ended some months ago  Took me some time to recover from that enough to get back on the apps  and when I did  I ve been pretty tentative   conservative in my swiping   What is crazy and honestly  unfathomable to me is the success I ve been having recently with conversion to dates and follow-up dates  I think the match rate is about the same as it was before  but the women have been much more open to meeting  and to follow-up dates  This week  I have dates on each day  with different people  and only one of them is a first date  which is actually the most promising I think   And unlike before  initiating and continuing conversations isn t something i m having to do alone  but seems to be equally carried on by the women too   The reason I m bringing this up is not to brag but to wonder what I m missing and when the shoe will drop  This seems too good to be true  and I tend not to trust when circumstances are favorable  Its really doing my head in trying to make sense of all this  because I ve never ever been in such a situation    For context  I m   M  in the US  No kids  and not sure I want  em  I m also not looking for a long-term relationship at the moment  I m certain that I am NOT good looking at all  very balding  not good looking  and about    lb overweight with what could be generously described as a dad bod   So I m just wondering if this is just a freak occurrence and things will soon settle back into the regular order  or is this a trend others have observed here  either over the years or specifically to dating in the   s 
Reddit,Appearance wise do you have a non negotiable ,I       F and for the most part I not bothered by appearance but here is the bad part  I can t with bad teeth  it s the one thing I am not able to forget about or move on from 
Reddit,Gave a girl my number and she unmatched me a day later ,Was talking to this girl through the weekend  seemed to be going well  give her my number Saturday and tell her to hmu with her name so i know who it is  I checked back today and she had unmatched me  Is this because she has my number  How long should I wait for a text         
Reddit,Have you ever used ChatGPT to talk to your matches ,If you have  have ever been called out on it 
Reddit,Got called a jerk because I said I wouldn t give validation to a girl,So I matched with this girl on pof  we started talking a bit but I noticed she wasn t too talkative  So I asked her if she was looking for a relationship or just validation or casual or just friends  She replied back saying she just got out of a relationship and wanted validation  so I replied that I m sorry but I m not looking for that  I m sure plenty of other guys will give you that on here  She proceeded to say I was a jerk and that I won t get far in anything with OLD  So I m confused  never ran into that before
Reddit,Am I being dramatic or was this uncalled for ,I matched with a guy earlier in the week and ended up talking on the phone with him for hours a day or two later  We had a fun conversation and it seemed to being going well  At one point he said that I looked like an animal  I don t want to say what  in the marsupial family   but he believes it is cute I do not  It caught me off guard and I was surprised he said that to me    I was picked on a lot even into my early college years by men  so I am used to it but it hurts when someone you thought was interested in you compares you to an odd looking animal  He was joking but I usually think there s some truth behind jokes like that  Call me sensitive but I actually cried a little thinking about this  it was out of nowhere and I had not said anything like that to him    This has happened to me a lot recently where men tell me pretty mean things that they think I look like  Ultimately they are pretty good guys and I m starting to think maybe I am just too sensitive and this is just to be expected    Again this is not even a week in for him to be calling someone a pet name or relating them to an animal I would think  It s been affecting me greatly because I don t get compliments from men  only slight jokes or insults that they always say they were  just kidding  about    I love when someone feels comfortable enough around me to express themselves freely but I can t help but feel like he really doesn t like me  I don t know what woman enjoys being compared to a marsupial physically  Any advice    Edited for clarity 
Reddit,Lack of communication,How would you act if a guy you have been dating for a short time has been showing communication issues   The issue is mainly this  he tends to disappear with no texting back for hours and hours  ignoring my messages  I asked him about this issue and he says he doesn t like texting much  especially when he s at work  which is fine  and when he s very tired  But I noticed this happens quite often  He tends to call at random times and send some vocals but texts are few and dry   Like for example  last night he had a work dinner and this morning I texted him to ask if it went well  He replied about a hour later and just said that he was very tired  I texted him just another short message but he completely ignored it and disappeared for the day  He never replied back   Am I being too clingy and insecure about this  Is it a possible red flag  I think I will start to reduce my communications as well and see what happens  Thoughts 
Reddit,Do any of you guys feel like you HAVE to initiate sex by the  rd date or else she ll lose interest ,I feel like there s a window of time to a woman s initial interest and the spark fizzles very quickly if things aren t progressing sexually   Every time I m in  rd date territory  I feel like I HAVE TO have sex on this date or I ll be locked out in friend zone land   It puts this really bad pressure on me knowing that if we don t  wine and board games at mine  she ll reject me even if we were objectively a good match originally   Am I the only one who feels like this   I d rather let things naturally happen even if it takes  -  dates  but my lived experience tells me the window of opportunity slams shut if I don t act pretty quickly even if we re both looking for a relationship   Thoughts 
Reddit,Why bother ,I ve seen other people complain about poor communication on dating apps  My personal experience is a wide spectrum  When someone doesn t have communication abilities  I just move on  I will do that with this guy but he does have me wondering about situations like this  I m    f   he s    m   What s your theory on this type of thing  Here are some theories on my mind      He s a boring person    He s bored and really has no intention of using the app to date    He wants to date but thinks he doesn t need to put in any effort    He wants to date broken women who will allow him to get away with little to no effort    He tries to keep women on the hook so that if the woman he s most interested in doesn t work out  he has a shallow pond from which to fish for the next one  I m interested to hear what other people think     I tried to post screen shots but it s not allowed  Here s the conversation that occurred over a few days   Him  Cute  comment on a photo  Me  Is that an accusation  Him  No  you re guilty  Me  I hope the punishment fits the crime  Him  Do you like being punished   Me  No  I think I should have thought through that sentence more before typing it   Him  Big weekend plans   Me  Not big but what I need  Lol A good mix of social time  down time  puppy time  and responsibilities  How about you  Him  Self aware - nice  What does social time and down time look like   Me  Social time is anything between brunch and movie night with friends - just depends on the day  It is usually never the bar scene but I go to bars for drinks  Today my son invited me to the Omnimax and tomorrow a friend invited me to dinner  Down time is usually to attend to houseplants  workout  learn how to do something  or go to the park  Downtime to me is anything I get to do for myself or with myself   Him  Wyd tonight   Me  I hung out with my son and worked on my class  What about you   Him  Nice  Mine wasn t very eventful   Me  You are a man of few words    Him  That I am 
Reddit,How to decline a  nd date and not be berated ,I think I m going to block and ghost from now on   It DOES NOT go well trying to respond with you don t feel he she is a fit with you  The man goes from so excited with me and asking for another date then goes so hate-filled mean and criticizing me  I do not like a basic stranger being this upset at me   It feels very threatening  How do you handle it 
Reddit,Would you ask for a second date even if the first date was awkward and the other person seemed uninterested ,In the event that you were still quite interested in them  but they had given off kind of standoffish uncomfortable vibes    Or would you just wait to hear from them    I went out with someone the other day and had been in a bit of a bad  edit weird  mood so I m thinking it s possible they aren t contacting me because they think I m not interested   but also I feel like this is delusional thinking and I should just let the person go and move on   Thank you for reading  and I d appreciate any advice   UPDATE  Thank you everyone for your comments  So at the end of that date he asked to exchange contact info and said that he would like to see me again   hopefully soon  but then radio silence  I decided to reach out to him    days after the date  I just said I got coffee during my lunch break at a cafe that he talked about and it was good  thank you for telling me about it  that I wanted to see him again  I ve been on delivered for   days now so I think I ll just take the L and move forward lol  It s nice to have clarity though so thank you to everyone who suggested reaching out

Reddit,Is this weird behavior ,I   m matched with   f on bumble  We talked a little on there but it was a slow back and forth  We switched to texting and snap when she apologize for the slow response on the app    We talked for about a week and talked about meeting up but with work and her having school and a full time job there was no specific day set  After about a week of good conversation she stopped completley texting back  Which is ok things didn t work out    But she still snaps me everyday but doesn t have a conversation  I was just wondering if this weird or a common occurrence for other people    Or if you have an idea why

Reddit,Is there a phrase for this going around ,I was just curious if there was a term out there for people who use online dating apps and never date or even speak to anyone     Example is - I swipe and swipe and swipe and maybe once every   months I ll get a match that doesn t respond       surely can t be considered online dating    Just a thought after someone asked me if I online date   I didn t even know what to say      Edit - I clearly worded this wrong  I m asking if there was a phrase for the person like me who is the one trying   I understand that the others do it for validation      It s seems like there isn t a cool phrase yet   Just being a loser   
Reddit,Is Tinder being crappy for anyone else ,  F  I ve had Tinder on and off for the last   years  Never had any issues  Bought subscriptions a few times when they were on sale without issue   Well last night a subscription went on sale and I bought it so I could see who had liked me  Almost immediately after that I started having problems  First they flagged me for having a social media handle in my bio-which I was very confused about since I never give out my social media and I don t even tag it  Hell I don t even have a spotify to tag  I figured out that it was because I mentioned one of the famous youtubers I like to watch so I took that out of my bio and thought all was well    This morning I open the app and it makes me do two of the captcha puzzles asking to select animals  I did both and it said I passed  Almost immediately after they said I was required to verify my account because I could be fake  At this point I was annoyed cause    this has never happened to me before    I JUST dropped money on a subscription only to start being immediately locked out and    I was in the middle of conversations    They asked me to submit a couple photos copying poses which I did and now I m waiting to see what happens next   Again I ve had Tinder on and off for   years  I m just an average woman  cute pretty but don t think I m hot  so I don t think I set off alarm bells like accounts of extremely attractive women do  I don t link socials  don t do OF  always interact respectfully  etc   Wondering if this has been happening to anyone else recently  
Reddit,How much do you pay attention to physical looks vs  lifestyle looks ,To be clear  I m figuring based on things I read that some people are making judgments about lifestyle and related attraction based on pics alone  which is why I didn t say pictures vs  lifestyle   For example  if a pic makes somebody looks obscenely physically flattering to you  but they are at a rave and you re not at all into that scene  does that factor in and if so  how much   I ve seen it as advice or analysis given in multiple places  about showing how you live via your pics in a way that is flattering to you  so I figure some people find it important   Personally  if I reflect on it  the main ones I can think of that throw me off is if somebody s lifestyle looks very thrillseeker or very outdoorsy  and then I feel like I just won t be able to keep up and will be holding them back  Otherwise  I don t think it registers that much for me and I feel like I ve become more open to whatever portrayal as time goes on  as long as I don t see obvious dealbreakers

Reddit,Am I too nice ,So  I made a match in a dating app by miracle of the Gods  I ve been talking with this girl for a few days and she said something interesting   She told me  I look too nice and healthy for OLD  And that that s why it doesn t work out for me   She also told me most matches ask for sex outright or send eggplant pics if they can  And that it s like that         I have Tinder  Bumble  Badoo and Okcupid  What I don t have is results and I ve spent months in them   Just to clarify  I don t live in the US  I am from a small third world country in Central America   I even compared my daily activity with hers and it was drastically diferent   I m moving to the US in a few months to see if it s any different  But what do you think

Reddit,How long of receiving no text initiating convo to assume they don t like you ,Started talking to this person   days ago  I sent them a compliment on Bumble and they were pretty bubbly and responsive the first day    I like them already but I now it feels like I m always the one initiating conversation and that they re just responding to me    My last relationship was like that and so I felt worried while also trying to remind myself that if they didn t wanna talk to me  they would just unmatch me  But what if they re one of those people that feels awkward about unmatching so they decide to just respond until you stop talking to them   My therapist said to ease up and not text them until they initiate conversation to see if they wanna actually talk to me    How many days will that be before I assume they just don t like me   I haven t dated in   years and I think I may be latching on too quickly  My therapist said to text other matches in the meantime but once I like someone  I physically can t have feelings for anybody else    I now dread when I see a notification from the app just to find that I matched with someone I swiped right on a while ago and not  them  texting me     DISCLAIMER  I m like     sure I have BPD but I m also autistic and hyper fixate on things real bad to where I can t see anything else sooo  
Reddit,Anyone else burned out from online dating ,I think its definitely time for a break  and Im curious if anyone else felt this way     year old female living in Los Angeles for context  I went back and forth on tinder and bumble  I got the most responses on tinder  while the better looking men and  quality  were on bumble  But after a string of first dates that went nowhere  Whether he wasnt interested  he was and I wasnt or mutally both not interested  Ive grown tired  Its the samething with every match  what do you do  what do you like blah blah blah  So many couples on these apps  so many poly men  and men who dont know what they want  Its become frustating  How do you guys deal 
Reddit,How patient is considered right when talking to a single mom ,I know this is more geared for males to reply but please anyone can reply  So I live in a rural area  about     of females on these dating apps are single mothers  Just curious how patient is considered fair when talking and trying to meet up  When is it a point to say they are truly busy with their kids or they just aren t interested or maybe just aren t good with conversations 
Reddit,Genetic matchmaking sites,   Do genetic matchmaking sites work  Any stories  I read about the t-shirt smell experiment and hla dna compatibility      One chick I met smelled really suuuper good to me naturally  made me crazy not bad crazy   Other women I just don t like the way they smell naturally   Not trying to offend anyone or support any eugenics stuff 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I personally find them frustrating but at the same time they allow you to meet people you d probably never meet irl  There s also always a danger to getting to know people online and then moving that over to real life 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I ve tried plenty of times  and I just hate them now  The more I swiped  the more I felt like choosing a product on a shelf  and I felt like a product myself    I feel like  if you want something serious and long term  you have to navigate through people who say they want something serious but actually just want a hookup  I can t count the number of times I ve matched with guys who wrote on their profile they wanted long term and after three texts they ask you if you live alone and what s your favorite sex position  There s nothing wrong with wanting hookups  but maybe you should be honest about it   However  I have met two guys on dating apps  and that led to relationships  Some good guys are on dating apps  I guess it can be hard to get to them 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I think they re the equivalent to slot machines at casino s and it s probably messing with people  I have used them but I always question it because it feels so hollow and not stimulating I guess 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Well  I dumpster dived my current boyfriend from one about   years ago  However  I wouldn t go back to those if I became single again  Way too dangerous and people are freaking weird man 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Hard pass
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Great if you re the type of person looking for hookups  But if you want love and a serious relationship then you ve gotta be prepared to put in a lot of work to sift through a sea of people   Also  as a bi woman  I particularly have a strong dislike for them even more because of what usually awaits me there 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Was the only way I could get into a relationship  Thanks to a combination of anxiety and introversion  I could never tell if someone was approaching with romantic intent until they d gotten bored and moved on   I ve met a few friends via the apps too  It s just a nice way to meet people you wouldn t otherwise
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Be careful  have standards  meet in public  and have fun

Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Can t date with them  can t date without them 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Very shady  but    it can work  there actually are decent people out there as well  I thought that only people who are after hookups use those  and i was in some point of my life where i thought even a hookup is better than nothing  so i joined a dating app  And to my surprise i found a really nice guy who is now my boyfriend  he was looking for a relationship  not a hookup and he was just using the app because he s too introverted to meet people irl  now we can happily spend our free time together playing video games or random silly games on bluestacks and we re glad we weren t afraid to use dating apps   and i have a few friends who met nice people through dating apps too  of course there are also a lot of stories of meetings going wrong 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,In my case they re a necessary evil 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Met my husband on one
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I wanna meet people the old fashion way
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Can work for some but can also be  dangerous   just be careful 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I ve used dating apps to meet my current and past partners  The current one is definitely a keeper  So while ultimately positive I had to block A LOT of men to find the right ones 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I d rather meet someone in person 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Met some good people  met some immature and disrespectful ones  It s a mixed bag  It s a nice way of meeting people you d otherwise never meet but the way dating apps are designed has conditioned folks to jump ship too easily  They re also full of avoidants 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I will never use a dating app  I like swiping on my friends  phones for fun sometimes but it just really shows me how shallow it all is - including the ones meant for relationships  not just hookups    In my opinion it is impossible to tell if I d want to chat with someone based on a few pictures and a description  Actually it makes me  not  want to  It feels so forced  I want to meet someone naturally  candidly 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,They usually suck  In my experience there s always  even though it s very hidden  something pretty huge wrong with the guys I meet on there  Maybe they think the same of me  But when I see an attractive guy on there who meets plenty of people in his own real life  I immediately think there must be some reason he is on a dating app which is usually not good  I m not saying there are only weird people on dating apps  hell I was on there too  but this is just my experience and something to think about 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I find them to be a breeding ground of broken men  and COVID has made them worse  I ve had no luck with them 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Full of liars  cheaters and predators  Tried it a couple times and never will again 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,It s        You ll meet decent people and you ll meet people that you wish you never met 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I hate them  Waste of time 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,A necessary evil nowadays  especially if your outside the norm of where you live 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I think it depends on what you are looking for at the time - when I first came out of a long term relationship I loved them for hookups  I m a bigger girl and very busty so I know I was attracting a lot of guys who wouldn t necessarily want something long term and I was ok with that   During the first lockdown I met my current bf on tinder and we clicked majorly like nothing I ve ever had before - I think it helped that we didn t rush into meeting and we took it slow  There are definitely roses among the weeds if you can be bothered to look for them    I d say dating apps are the way to meet people - no one approaches people in bars anymore especially with the rise in the cost of living people don t go out as much and when you reach a certain age most of your friends have kids and are married so they aren t as available to go out with 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,It s really meant for hookup culture  If you re into that  then you re in the right track  If looking for anything meaningful and LTR  it s going to take a lot of time finding someone who is intentionally looking for the same thing 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I think the people you meet on dating apps can hugely depend on your instincts and intuitive nature in general  I see myself to be a good judge of character and have met some pretty cool ppl on there  You don t necessarily have to find your perfect match but you can always unmatch if the vibe is off or continue the convo if you re seeing a potential  Its honestly so convenient bc dating in the real world is hard these days 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,For men  a waste of money  for women  a waste of time 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Can be dangerous and most I think are used by a high amount of users only there looking for sex   very low amount of users are actually looking for a serious relationship
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Really great for meeting people outside your social circles everyday paths  It works well if you use it for making initial contact   not really great for having a long convo through text   In my experience it worked best when you set a meetup quickly   I don t mean hook ups  just a walk or coffee  then decide if you want to know each other further 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Not always guaranteed a serious relationship but proceed with caution    My very first meetup from Tinder turned into a serious relationship  my current bf  simply because we were both straightforward on what we are looking for  However  I ve spoken with plenty dudes but it was either not long enough to set up a date or conversations were bland that I would lose interest 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I ve met a lot of people who have met their SO in one  I met my boyfriend using one  and we live in places and communities so far from each other that there s no way we would ve met if it wasn t for the app  so I encourage it   Of course  be careful and mind that many success stories have been very lucky 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Hate them  can t stand using them and when I try  I m reminded again of how awful they are 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Great for holiday hookups but I don t use it in my home city because of how bad it is  It genuinely confuses me when I see couples who met on Tinder because I ve had nothing but horrible experiences on there when I have tried to find something a bit more serious 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I appreciate seeing how awful the dating pool is in my area from the comfort of my own home  Nothing makes me more at peace with my decision to stay single than downloading the apps for a day or two and seeing what is out there 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,i like them  fun way to meet new people as long as you re upfront about your intentions 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,They re great when you don t really have time to get out and meet people organically  Ive made some great connections through dating apps 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I found my current partner on one  but prior to him it was all rotten luck and first dates only  The only reason I even responded to him was because we went to primary school together and had many mutuals and I knew him to be a decent guy  I also know others who ve met their long term partners on there  so it s not all slim pickings  but it takes effort 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,They can work and it s good they exist  but they make me so fatigued
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,they re okay  i met my current boyfriend of one and a half years on tinder  took literal years to find him tho  but i don t think i d do it again if we broke up  too much sifting through the bullshit that i don t have time for anymore 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Got lucky and found my now husband through one but for the most part they re very draining 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I met my hubby on tinder  We got married on the date we matched    It can work  we are also not the only tinder couple in our circle either  
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,The format is fine - well  it used to be fine until they all went to swipe format  RIP pre      OKCupid    But as they become more popular and more people flock to them  the content just turns to crap  So many boring or otherwise awful people  I miss the days when it was mostly hella nerds and little else 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Never again 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Nope  the only time I had one was Bumble but to make girl friends  and too much effort haha it didn t work so I deleted it 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I hate them but I can t do without them because nobody seems to want to interact in real life anymore   I haven t had any success with them lately or really in general  I know I should quit but I haven t 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Not for me
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,When I was single I DL tinder and deleted same day bc it was so disgusting
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Great for hookups  frustrating if you are looking for love serious relationships  You ve gotta sift through a lot of people to find the true gems  My best friend met her fianc  on Bumble   my roommate met her boyfriend  soon-to-be fianc   on Tinder so it is possible  but generally you ll meet chat with a good amount of weirdos   horndogs
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,If you re into hookups and being invited to threesomes then dating apps are for you  If you actually want to find a relationship    you should actually get out there and find one the old fashioned way 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Not worth it  Mostly filled with people that want to get their ego validated  You d have to kiss a thousand toads to meet a prince  Besides I don t want to be that easily accessible to anyone 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,OLD has made it easy to get relationships and easier to leave them as well  I know many nice guys   girls who just off them because everyone has a threshold for pain   being deceived  More people on them are lying from names to ages to what not  Some are even married and lying  Someone was on parole as a lady posted in a group  Its a dangerous world and when u r putting all ur information out there  u never know who has what intentions  Left them in      after someone lied to me about name and everything else  I kept asking myself if i was foolish enough to not know but then i FBI on him   found everything about him any way  Now im forever scarred  Never going back again  If he wants to find me  he s welcome to break through the window 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,They re exhausting  I m sure you can find a good person  but it s like looking for a needle in a haystack  just to find a good person who goes on a decent date  I ve given up on the apps so many times because it takes forever to find someone you re attracted to  match  actually start a conversation  actually get to a first date  and make it past that 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,They are a way to meet people   While there are a number of creeps  incels  and jerks on there  there are also people who take looking for a partner seriously    I know   friends that have met partners during the pandemic on apps  So I know they can work  You just have to weed through the muck   While meeting people in person would be great   every day life has become decentralized to the extent that meeting a partner in person isn t as easy   Most people don t attend church   work is remote  and in my experience  less diverse in terms of gender  Social groups are gender specific or inundated with couples   I would like there to be better ways for people to verify their identity and a way to disallow anyone with a criminal background to be active  There have been toi many horror stories for there not to be better monitoring and regulation 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Make an effort to meet people irl  they re outside
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,They are hit or miss  I stopped relying solely on using one app like Tinder to meet a partner  or spending hours at a time swiping  And of course using apps in addition to getting outside and mingling with people in real life can be helpful  I want to feel relaxed and focus more on authentic human interactions instead of just finding  the one  
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I am very glad that I have been with my husband for    years  so I avoided them  I ve met all my partners organically and would hate to have to use them if I became single  Heard nothing but bad stories from my girl and boy friends
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,At the time when I was using them I lived in a metroplex of almost   million people   The dating sites had some decent honest  people  but mostly were full of users and losers  I was lucky to have so many opportunities to meet normal people IRL  so I quit the scene to find Men who were actually engaged in some of the interests I shared   My heart goes out to people who live in very small towns or rural areas and have almost no other way to meet
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I m a single mom  There aren t many places to meet people anymore  My church is online service  I don t do bars and wouldn t at this point  My job is work from home  I attend all of my kids  extracurricular functions  but so do all of the parents  most of whom are married  Sigh 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Hookups   Annoying to try and date anyone these days   especially  if you re an adult with a family and responsibilities looking for something other than  a good time    now if these hookups offered some handyman services I may be inclined   
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Guy here  i get plently of dates  But mostly all feel like damaged goods  Came out of a  yr relationship and i uninstalled it after   months  Mostly all girls are   -   yr olds and only think highly of themself and are not genuine people   I guess its good for fucking 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I used to say I would never in my entire life be on them   What if I saw someone I knew    Although if I ever end up divorced I m sure I ll eat my words and join the day the ink is dry 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I m currently trapped in a pause hide profile and delete and then re-install app  a few days later   One could say I m not living my best life  It s like some kind of perpetual shit cycle that I don t want a part of 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,A fun way to kill boredom
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,It s not my preferred method  but I have met some nice people on there  It s much easier for straight girls than straight guys because men typically like a ton of profiles  but women are very careful in their selection and matching   Also  the amount of guys that would get so many more likes if they just learned how to properly take a picture     astronomical
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I personally don t use them  mainly cuz rn I m in a relationship - not from a dating app   I think that I can be dangerous cuz of cat fishing but there s something very rewarding about meeting people face to face
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I ve never felt comfortable with them so have never done it  Married now so will never have to

Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,They make it easier for people to find a partner so I can t hate on them for that  Of course you ll meet your fair share of assholes there but you ll meet those anywhere 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I used to go on them    years ago when they were still  new   Even then  there were a lot of romance scammers  or guys with photographs at least    years out of date  too many looking for a bangmaid  or replacement mom for their kids  I met any guys that interested me  by what they wrote in their profiles  but none ever made it beyond two meetings  If a guy cannot offer some interesting conversation when you meet them  it doesn t bode well 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I ve been using them since      with some breaks when I find someone to have a serious relationship with  Now I m single and back on it and it s really really hard to find someone interesting and stimulating  It s drained out  or maybe it s because I m almost    with no patience left for games and blablabla 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,For what they re worth it s just too much work 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,For me as someone who never used dating apps  and somehow both times I got into a relationship it always started before going on dates  the idea in itself is nice  the concept is okay    People can t be trusted with it though  It can be dangerous and very damaging emotionally  It seems like it s hard to find something serious there as well 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I give up on them
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Hate them  BUT     I met my boyfriend on badoo  We started off as friends  playing online games  and it naturally evolved from there  I was on the verge of deleting the app before we matched  I was worried because I am on the chubby side and he is   well  way too good for me  
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I met my fianc  on a dating app  yrs ago  You have to know what you want solidly and not only expect that  but be real with yourself and the people you meet and decline a second date if they aren t meeting what you re looking for   I m not saying to be picky  I m saying if you can tell they re not looking for what you re looking for  don t pursue it and don t waste your time     Aka don t settle for a fuck boy if you re looking for a relationship  no  you re not going to be the one to change them

Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,They re completely alien to me because I got out of the dating scene before they became a thing  I guess they can be good because they can help you meet people you probably wouldn t otherwise connect with but I ve heard so many negative stories that if I were to ever be on the dating scene again I don t think I would even bother

Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,They re the worst  I know some people who ve had some good luck with apps  even one couple that got married and everything  but still  They re the worst 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I met my boyfriend on one  but if I ever have to date again I m not getting back on them 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I don t like them for me  They re all about looks and a few sentences about personality  But I need to meet someone in real life to know if I m interested  Even if it s just for a minute or two  I can make a decision  But I don t want to have endless awkward dates with guys that I already know from the first seconds on  that I m not interested 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Some of my friends and family have had good luck on them  Others  tell me about the shit show  I ve purposely never been on them  but I ve had the opportunity to meet people out in the wild  Even if I didn t though  I don t think I could bring myself to get on an app  Being raised by a cop and living in a lot of different places has opened my eyes to some of the crazy out there  I wish my friends the best of luck and ask them to be safe  inform friends of where they are and such 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I don t like them    I prefer not to use them  I think it s dehumanizing and it takes away from finding a connection with someone  When it comes to dating that should be the most important part is connection but everything is reduced to superficial things  A cute pic  a small paragraph  and half of the people don t want to date they just want like sex on demand    If you prefer casual dating and relationships the apps are great  But if you want something serious it s a huge waste of time and energy 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,No

Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Have never been on one myself  despite some pressure from friends  My brother met his wife on one and she s wonderful  but I feel that was one in a million at our early    s age  at the time     Truthfully  my view on it is - I have never had any problems meeting someone  in the wild  or through multiple connections so why not continue doing that  If I m supposed to be single  then I ll be single until life puts someone in my path  It s one thing to be looking for someone to share a life with  and it s another to be LOOKING for someone  Questions I had to ask myself when I almost gave into the pressure  Do I really need someone right now  or am I just looking for immediate comfort  Why can I not go try new activities outside to potentially meet new people but instead of stay in and swipe for hours  What is appealing about talking to multiple potential partners when they have a catalogue of other people   For me  talking to multiple people in a romantic capacity is absolutely exhausting    Also  I think dating apps make it so easy to move on and not have to sort through problems  No relationship will be perfect  but when you literally have an infinite pool of individuals at your finger tips people don t stay when things get hard  I think you can find the      be missing that     and think  oh well there are many out there I just have to look at my phone   This doesn t set you up for a successful relationship in any scenario and I want no part of it 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Took me about   years on the dating apps to meet my current bf and he is the best so for sure it can work  There s a lot of guys that suck but you learn through dating what you want and don t want in a relationship so I have zero regrets 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,It was ok  but I greatly prefer in-person dating as I m more comfortable with it 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Most are shit  but you do find the occasional good match  Some I ended up just making friends with   keep up online  I ve met quite a few people from Twitter  which seems a lot more preferable than swiping on a dating app    I did meet my current partner on Hinge  Going on    months together

Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,  years ago I met a wonderful boy on Tinder  In      we will be celebrating our  th year anniversary  So for me it worked out great  But the majority of people there are definitely looking for a hookup  I had to filter through a lot of bs before I stumbled on him

Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,They can be especially useful for people who are shy or have a hard time meeting people in person  Some dating apps use algorithms to match users based on compatibility  while others allow users to browse through profiles and message people they re interested in

Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,They re great if you want to be told how hot you are every day  shite if you want someone to actually give a damn about how you are or how your day went   Of course there are some exceptions  but they are the exception rather than the rule 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I have noticed that a lot of the men on there  especially the attractive ones  are emotionally unavailable and join the apps during a down period in their lives - broken hearted after being dumped and want to hook up with women to self-soothe  want to find validation by talking winning over multiple women etc  It s a breeding ground for men when they re not in the best mental place      The men who I ve met who are serious on the apps were frankly unattractive  greatly lacked confidence and were socially awkward when we met  won t look at me in the eyes and kept looking around  very shy  which I don t like either   I want someone who has the same level of confidence and self-assuredness that I have

Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Not for me personally 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Only if you re young  really good looking  without kids  and most likely just looking for a hookup no matter what is written in your profile    It gives too much freedom to pass over every single person except the  perfect  person which doesn t exist    It s just weird too  Like you re dating someone to see if you want to date them  not the other way around    But I guess this is the only way of the future     
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Not really interested   Way too many people out there who re as fake as plastic  if you re a woman looking for a guy then there s an     chance of having to work your way through a sea of D pics  hearing of some genuine horror stories about dating apps  too many people who make dating as something political in a toxic way  and just the concept of using a dating app doesn t intrigue me enough to try it

Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,The worst
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,honestly with how us newer generations are i think its kinda essential at this point  no point in having ambiguity of what each others intention is by getting to know a person through natural means all for it to be a farce  the mutual understanding that you both know whta youre looking for with dating apps makes everything so much easier 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,I won t do it  I don t believe it is a mirror of real life  Energy cannot be adequately conveyed through a picture compared to seeing a stranger in person

Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,They work out for some people  My sister met her husband on Tinder   years ago and they have a wonderful relationship with two awesome kids    I hopped on Bumble after splitting with my ex last year and lasted two days before deleting it after some dude got way too worked up because I was busy and didn t answer fast enough for him  I don t want to sift through that garbage in the hope that I might find a gem  Given the choice I decided being single was far preferable  and I d rather meet someone organically when the time is right  Which I did

Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Quantity but not quality
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,They have a bad rep but they can work depending on how you use them and if you re willing to weed through a bunch of crap  haha 
Reddit,What are your views on dating apps?,Perhaps somewhat helps highly introverted people when it comes to dating relationships  but is somewhat detrimental to others       There is some research that shows the dating culture that has is being shaped by dating apps is producing some negative psychological effects   as well as  negatively  affecting the quality of life relationships   And I think that until some sort of normalisation process occurs  whereby humans somehow adapt to this abundance of choice  perhaps acceptance of polyamory  less priority of committed long term relationships and or need of labels  etc   the usage of dating apps will be detrimental for mental health human relationships  And that dating apps have pushed this hookup culture that is also again detrimental to the emotional wellbeing of people       Also the local consumer dating app research department  or something along those lines  found some fairly iffy practices   in regards to privacy data concerns  exploitation  and things like charging certain age groups more money  without disclosing  etc etc   And of course  knowing that dating apps ultimately work to earn money of their customers clients  which means they do not want to show give you your perfect matches   and algorithms match people with just good enough to date hookup but not for long term relationships  or whatever it is the client claims to be looking for  thus keeping people on their apps paying for membership or premium accounts  I think it s logical to infer that they re not made for peoples   clients customers  best interest in mind       Look at all the complaints on reddit alone   nearly everyone posting in that dating advice reddit is complaining about meeting people on dating apps  I don t recall anybody saying they ve met  or even considering   meeting people via means other than apps         Honestly I feel pretty bad about people who gotta date in this sort of climate where dating apps has become the primary method of finding a match now  I know most of my single friends  who honestly are very decent good great catches  have been on these apps for years and not had any substantial relationship that have even lasted beyond  months  Whereas couples I know that have met IRL  basically right before this giant dating app boom  have been in long term committed relationships since  Barely even have to date around  probably just a few months out of their last relationship   perhaps some did have a dating app s  to meet some randoms explore choices  but everyone ended up dating being with the person they met IRL
