Reddit,Today I received my sign to take a break ,My was in a   year very up and down relationship from     -      Things ended notoriously badly as they do in the types of relationships   I haven t spoken to my ex fianc  in nearly two years  she s married everyone moved on but both friend groups dislike each other now  and today I saw her best friend on Bumble  She must ve gotten a divorce  so whatever  that s fine  I was surprised to see her so I was scrolling down her profile  she looks good  But I don t like her and I m sure she doesn t like me  well  we all know how easy it is to Superlike someone on accident and there s no taking it back   I was mortified  My daughter could hear me yelling SHIT  across house  haha   I deleted my profile rather than let her think I meant to do that  ,Negative
Reddit,Facebook dating shows up as an option on my substitute account but not on my real account  What gives ,I m the last single person among my friends  several have recommended FB dating but it just will not appear on my main account  It will  though  on the same phone using a backup account I do not intend to date with  I m already frustrated from being lonely  I don t need to be aggravated by this shit too  Any thoughts ,Negative
Reddit,Advice  please,I was chatting on bumble with a woman  She seemed a bit over excited to meet me  so I gave more time between chats hoping she would cool her jets  Tbh I had too much work on my hands as well   One day I find out she undid our match  Yesterday she sent me a Facebook friend request  She didn t know my last name  So my guess is she found me on Google search  Not a difficult thing after some information we shared  She sent a few messenger lines saying she said she missed me and hoped I was well   What should I do  Block her  Or simply let the request hang there until she forgets about me  I m not interested in chatting any further with her  But I m a bit fearful she might be a stalker  What are your thoughts ,Negative
Reddit,Is it worth swiping right if you don t get likes ,Was having this debate with a buddy of mine who says because he s not getting any likes he doesn t bother swiping  I said it could be his profile  but I still swipe right selectively even though I rarely get likes too   What are your thoughts ,Negative

Reddit,Do men enjoy texting before the first date ,Chatting with a guy on an app  I asked if he wanted to meet up  He said definitely  gave me his number  We haven t scheduled anything yet because neither of us are available for    days  He s been texting me daily  not annoying or over the top  I m just curious if this is something that men do because they are excited or like texting  Or if they feel like this is what women want they need to do to stay relevant  I don t like to text alot before the first date and plan to tell him so once something is scheduled but I am a little afraid of offending him ,Neutral
Reddit,Getting sad over getting ghosted  Weird ,I didn t even know her  I matched with her on Hinge and I thought she was very cute   similar interests  It usually gets me excited because most girls on these apps are really boring to me  and girls who are both physically attractive and with similar interests are kinda rare  She was enthusiastic at first  and I don t think I said anything wrong at all  She ghosted me out of nowhere  I don t understand why  It sucks ,Negative
Reddit,Does anyone pay for a service ,I m curious  so many of the big sites charge for every little thing as they struggle to survive    Does anyone pay for these  I mean  if their terms weren t so off putting  I might  Maybe I just want to pay for   or   months  and not have to go through the cancelation process which seems difficult    Any advice for this- paying then canceling later  Things to be aware of   Thanks ,Negative
Reddit,Question or vent off  Amazing convo one day and then nothing  why ,Hey   So  I      have been having great conversations with several people throughout the last couple weeks  I am cool with keeping up the conversation going  and if they are reciprocating I make jokes and ask questions or even if the conversation if dry comment on it and make a suggestion and turn it around    Then  the next day we exchange a couple messages and I of course don t expect non stop conversation everyday  it would be nice  but we are adults and life happens  But then  nothing  I message most of the time to check in  but I don t get a response for several days  And sometimes never   I had a situation where the guy would just disappear in the middle of the conversation and never even said sorry the next evening    So  I understand they may be busy  they may not be into me  they may be bored of OLD etc  But this happened several times  I had a    year relationship and then found my next bf quickly online  dated for     years  I wasn t even looking for a relationship which made it easier not get disappointed    My question is   Is this the new norm  Like should I be expecting this  I don t know what to do in this situation  How long do you wait for a response  Should I just keep them as a match or unmatch like after a week so they are out of my mind  How many times should I remind myself if I kinda liked the person   I was ready to give chance to people that I thought cute and I liked their profile  Now  I am thinking unless I see someone and say yes this is my dream guy gal  I don t want to put any effort in it  I need equal amount of effort put in  so I think this is important to me  I want to feel like I am wanted  I made my profile intense-ish so that people know I want something serious  Like I put in that I am looking for someone to fall in love    What do you do in these situations  Should I see online dating as a socialization option or a place to just practice flirting  Please tell mewhat is up ,Negative
Reddit,Why do younger people have NO conversation ,I m saying  people  because maybe it s the same with men  I don t know  my experience has been with women  Even women that were actually interested in me  that went on dates with me or even slept with me  the majority of younger women have no conversation skills or are uninteresting as hell  The ones that knew how to handle a conversation and show personality were the older ones   How is that  Is our generation particularly socially inapt ,Negative
Reddit,I am genuinely curious  is online dating past your   s just a completely joyless experience ,I am a male  I ve kept my looks I think and am     I am financially well off  However there is literally zero girls that I am bothered with  Even if the girl is v attractive it takes me a bit to be bothered let alone feel she would be a good match  However I don t even have this opportunity  I match with some girls who are okay looking but I am just not going to date them  I have to be very attracted and if that s not there its just pointless  The problem is this mindset makes me overly latch onto someone who does meet that criteria and I become over caring where my strength is actually how little I care and how content I am by myself ,Negative
Reddit,is this a red flag ,  I    f  matched with a guy on bumble and we decided to meet yesterday  An hour before the decided time to meet  he messages that he s still at work   would like to meet at        I was really excited to meet him and was really disappointed as I don t really want to meet a stranger this late at night  After showing him some disappointment  he dint really do much to make it up  He was like sorry can t leave work and I left him on seen  He hasn t messaged after that  Did I do something wrong   Also he s confused about what he wants   I want a relationship,Negative

Reddit,Did the apps punish me for having a month and a half break ,Hey guys  I was doing quite well on hinge and tinder     likes for a guy  Lots of meet ups  And bumble     likes   I then went on a date with this girl  she abused me and shamed me for not being     and laughed about it  It really hurt my confidence  I basically stopped using the apps maybe ocassionally swiped but didn t respond to matches or really use the apps at all tbh  I needed a break    A month and a half later I m trying to use them again  First off I noticed I lost    likes off my hinge  And my tinder went from     down to       Also I don t seem to be getting and new likes anymore and barely any matches  On ocassion it happens but I used to get at least one new like a day on tinder and hinge    What happened    It is possible to fix this  Do I have to buy a boost or something to get people to see my profile again  I m guessing my score went down for being inactive or something  I have good photos though  you can see them on my wall actually    Bumble I barely have   likes and get almost no new likes as well  Please help guys   ,Negative
Reddit,Yuzu everyone is far away  ,So I ve been using Yuzu for a couple of weeks now  Even though I live in NYC   where there should be a preponderance of Asians  let alone people in general   lately all the people in my stack are hundreds of miles away  It s not even like I m massively overswiping  Is anyone else finding this sort of issue ,Negative
Reddit,should i give up on my crush ,here s the backstory me F   and this person M     he is really shy btw  have been talking since december     i saw his profile on hinge  and i ve decided to send him a message  we went to the same high school and we had classes together but we didn t start talking until now  since we ve started talking i ve told him that i love voice calls and that i prefer them over texts  although with this info that i ve given him  he hasn t called me and every time i try to bring it up he says  oh yeah we should  also he lives five minutes away and we haven t hanged out yet  i keep giving him hints of the days off that i have from work and all he says is  yeah we should hang out sometime  and i told him to set a time and date and he agreed  it s been a month and we have yet to hang out and or even have a simple call  i think he is a cute guy and very intelligent and i d love to be more close with him  he has complimented me a few times as well  am i wasting my time here or am i rushing things ,Negative
Reddit,The Flakiness and the White Lies on the Apps are Wild ,Here s a little story that happened this week   On Saturday  this woman from NYC liked me on Hinge  and we matched  Instantly  we were having multiple chat-bubble conversations about everything about each other  we were definitely very interested in each other   Monday she suggests I come up to the city to see her on Friday  today   I ask her if she s cool with Midtown  and she says yes  and I ask her where in Midtown does she want to meet up  does she prefer bars  restaurants  or museums for our first date  etc  She stops texting me Wednesday   Until she stopped texting me  she was pretty fast at replying  I was curious what happened  so while I was checking our chats yesterday  I saw that her location on her profile changed from NYC to somewhere in France  Weird   Anyway  today I text her to ask if we are still on or not for NYC  to which she says we are not  and that she is sorry that she can t  since she is  going through a lot right now   This is when I noticed that the location on her profile is now ITALY   I don t know if this woman was even real  or some bougie European man swept her off her feet and flew her out to Europe or what  Maybe I m quick to judge here  but     The flakiness on these stupid apps isn t uncommon from my experience  I ve been getting a fair amount of matches a day on these apps recently  today I got over     and it never goes anywhere ,Negative
Reddit,Advice please   ,So a few weeks ago I started talking to this person on bumble  we both had a lot of common interests and she was really interesting  She seemed pretty enthusiastic about the conversation but when I asked her if she wanted to meet up some morning for coffee she said she gets overwhelmed very easily and needs to take things super slow  I told her I understood and assured her that I would be patient  and that if she was more comfortable texting or calling me on the phone instead of messaging on bumble that was cool  gave her my number  She just said she wanted to talk through bumble a bit longer to feel comfortable  Cool with me  We ve been talking every day for about three weeks  I m being careful not to make her feel pressured because I want her to be comfortable  Last time I talked to her she said work had been crazy and she was feeling burnt out  I told her I hoped she got some rest and I hoped tomorrow was a little easier  That was three days ago and no reply  I m trying to be patient and I m hoping she s just busy but I want to reach out really bad  I don t want to bother her if she doesn t want to talk anymore  I sent her the last message  but maybe I m supposed to reach out again  I m not sure what to do next  Wait or check in ,Neutral
Reddit,Why is dating online hard ,I have been able to match with a few woman over the years on these apps but they were a total waste of my time    A large majority of the women I matched with were a long distant away and I did match with a few nearby but they were just on the app to waste your time  very boring to talk to or just wanted to hookup   Most of the women that liked me only seemed interested in hooking up or they rushed their feelings for me too soon  some of them were pretty but I didn t feel comfortable rushing into a relationship so soon    The women I did match with that found me really attractive were like in Europe  Asia or Africa so there was no way I was gonna get on a expensive plane ticket just to go see them so I cut them off and quit the dating online dating entirely because I can t seem to match with anyone serious near me   Why doesn t anyone in online my country wanna date me  I m a hard working man that works two jobs until I come home exhausted  I have a lot of skills like fixing cars  doing the plumbling  fixing stuff or simply changing your tire  Why would a  woman wouldnt a man like me    Edit  just to clarify these women I matched with were real because I videocalled them time to time just to chat or show them my life ,Negative
Reddit,When I set my daiting profile to guys I get likes almost instantly ,This has been a weird thing  If I set my Tinder  Facebook  Bumble to match with guys  Within a few hours I have multiple likes  I am a   M who is straight  Does this happen to other guys as well  I recently had a really creepy incident to where an older coworker wanted to explorer Facebook dating  So I changed my age preferences to     Within   hours of changing my age  I had over    likes matches with guys that were in their   s and   s ,Negative
Reddit,Why is online dating so much harder than irl ,This is my first time trying out online dating after many years of being in a relationship and I guess I missed out on the better times which is the early days  I consider myself to be quite a social person irl and talking to friends on texts and didn t had much difficulty back when I was dating   First  profile  I tried making a good one but I know there s a lot of rooms for improvements and because I was in a relationship for so many years  I never bothered taking photos especially the recent years lol   Second  openers  I think I m slowly improving on this after trying out for awhile now but man it s still really difficult  How do you even come up with good ones even looking at their profile and trying to come up with interesting ones that is not hey or how s your day  Sometimes I think I got a pretty good opener to prompt but no replies but it s fine  a good practice  On some apps like Hinge  I gave a pretty good reply to their prompts  they matched but don t reply or say anything expecting me to continue  wow it s just   depressing    Third  conversations  So finally after sifting through so many profiles and got to the stage of matching and after the initial openers  comes keeping up with the conversation  Sometimes I get that good starting conversation going but I feel like it just went downhill from there like how do I keep up with this  It s mentally draining to keep trying to be engaging and sometimes they re quite responsive  until they re not and it feels like dead conversation again   Last but not least  asking them out  I feel like I may be asking too soon so I try to chill on asking them out but when I finally do  sometimes it feels like they re not really that keen or so busy that the plan could be weeks later instead of that weekend lol   Online dating seems like a totally different game and it s feels like I have a lot to learn ,Negative
Reddit,I m old enough to know    m  not to get too obsessed with looks then I matched with someone who is really gorgeous ,I m not saying that looks don t matter  yet I do know that it s important to be realistic and not get carried away with appearances  I was just browsing on a dating app  and I come across a woman holding her dog  she s wearing  sunglasses with blonde hair that is partially covering her face  Not the best picture  but I can tell she s pretty hot  kind of  out of my league   I swiped right without reading her profile  and the app says we matched    At first I was like  really   Then I go back and look at her profile  she sounds really cool  And her other picture truly gorgeous  Almost  too perfect   I know I m probably overthinking this  What s the best way to compliment someone without sounding creepy or  thirsty  ,Neutral
Reddit,Glad she blocked me ,I   m  met a very pretty girl    f  online     We chatted for a few days and finally planned to meet in person for a drink     In the days leading up to the date  we texted over iMessage   Just basic keeping in touch and telling about our day   On the Thursday before our Friday meet-up  I was heading out to meet up with some friends guys    I showered and dressed nice and took a selfie in the mirror and sent it to her    Heading out to meet up with friends  I said   Her response was   your friends or your wife    I thought that was odd  but just sent an  lol   and replied that I have been divorced for    years already   She didn t respond   I liked the picture I took of myself  so I uploaded it to my dating profile      While I was out with friends  she texted me    Did you actually post the picture you took for me    Feeling weird  but not really  I said   yes why     She replied   That speaks volumes  Lose my number    And blocked me on her phone and on the app   Pretty possessive from someone I hadn t even met yet no ,Negative
Reddit,What are some tips you d give to an online dating newbie ,Hey all    F here - so I have pretty limited experience with dating apps  due to all my past relationships started as organic connections  I ve been single for about a year and a half and recently started to miss dating so I gave Hinge a whirl  I matched with   guys to start off  made plans to meet all of them the same week  Thu  Fri  Sat   and  paused my profile   personal preference to help me focus on the immediate dates    I clicked with Mr  Thursday right away - which didn t happen with Mr  Friday   Saturday   I ve respectfully let them know I had a good time but didn t see anything going further after each   As for Mr  Thursday  we ve been talking every day since the first date  and I had a second date with him  which felt more like the first actual date and he held my hand   We ve just been getting to know each other  but we ve both been pretty transparent about our mutual interest in each other  We have serious conversations and also talk about things to do together   I ve never clicked with someone off of online dating before so I m a bit scared - I kinda dig this guy but it s so strange to want to date someone I know so little about  given my history of only having dated men I knew well personally   I think I also have the  it s unrealistic for things to go well with the first guy  line of doubt when all I ever hear about are the woes of online dating   Do any of you have tips for a newbie to online dating   Some specific questions if you don t have anything general to toss out  should I   unpause my profile   and continue looking for additional dates despite how things are going well with this guy  a la don t put all your eggs in one basket   Are there   any flags to look out for when dating strangers   with whom you have no mutuals who can vouch for their character  When should I be optimistic and when should I be pessimistic about a date   If any of you make the time to read through this and share tips  thank you ,Positive
Reddit,He responds quickly but gives answers that don t give me much to go on  Why does he do this ,Matched with a guy  on Bumble  and we ve been messaging for about a day now  Like the title says  he s quick to respond to me  but he also doesn t ask me questions about myself and so I ve become the one carrying the conversation and asking all the questions  Normally would think that if he s not asking questions back he s just not interested but usually this happens when the guy is slow to respond  So why would he respond quickly if he doesn t seem interested and care to get to know me ,Neutral
Reddit,Why online dating is so hard for both genders ,It s like a     degree difference  but it affects both genders  Women have SO many matches with men  it s overwhelming  When you are getting      matches a day  week  it s hard to pick one guy based on a profile picture  This goes for all online dating   For men  it s the opposite problem  I feel like if you wanted to see an average guy  that is me  I m      dad bod  thinning hair     years old  I may get   matches a month  My story is probably true for the vast majority of men   What happens is you have women with so many choices in men  they become overwhelmed and go after  for the most part  the best looking guys  Let s be honest  if it was reversed and men had all the matches  this exact same thing would be happening to us    Those of us men who are average are kind of left in the dust  We cannot compete with the top guys  Leaving a lot of men feeling bitter and angry   I do not know what the answer is  A lot of both genders are miserable with dating  but for vastly different reasons  What do you think could be some answers  Would love to hear everyone s thoughts ,Negative
Reddit,How to make it clear you don t do hook ups without saying  no hookups  ,I m     I ve clearly chosen the  looking for a relationship  and  want kids  options on my profile  I don t give off any vibe either with behaviour or clothing of someone who is looking for a  nd date hook up  Yet I am so sick of guys dropping me after I don t go to their place by the second or third date  They act very interested  until I don t respond to their hints to go to their place  And then they disappear   Also happened with guys I met IRL  before I used dating apps at all    I don t have any rule of any sort about when I d sleep with someone  I guess it s when I become comfortable  Especially with guys from dating apps it takes me longer because they are a practical stranger after all    But I don t know what else to put on my profile to make it clear  Obviously none of that  no time wasters  or  serious guys only  stuff  it is very off putting  but I don t know how else to say it      Looking for relationship-oriented men    I don t want to scare anyone off either  in a world that is commitment-phobic as you know it  and this sounds like it might scare people off   I want to get to know people to see if we share values  chemistry  goals  etc  and see where things go  I don t want to  boyfriend up  the first guy I meet  But I don t want anyone to think anything else either  Any suggestions   PS  I feel strange here I am being bashed that I m basically a prude for not sleeping with a stranger after meeting him twice  I wasn t asking for advice on this either   I guess this speaks of the expectations and dating culture overall  If you will lecture me on why I have to sleep with someone after  -  dates so I don t hurt his ego  don t bother - I am who I am and my level of comfort regarding these things won t change because of a reddit comment ,Negative
Reddit,Online dating scammer is going that extra mile,I was already suspicious but I was bored  He is supposedly  M    Divorced    child    Talked  to the guy on Bumble for two days   He asked for my number to video chat  I use a  nd line on my real phone for these things  We  exchanged numbers and set a time to call   He called and hung up before I answered  It was only on the second ring   I called the number back  No answer   I get a text that he had his son for the evening and couldn t video chat  Fine   We scheduled for two days later   This person is using some type of still shot with a voice talking        So much feedback and noise in the line  I turned my camera off  He never even mentioned it   I asked why he wasn t Live  He said he was not at home and didn t want to show other people but didn t want to miss the video chat again   We talked about    minutes   He is supposedly living in NY for    years   Born and raised in Indonesia  He has sent a bunch of photos  English is good but thick accent  All professional looking so I go to the identify pic app and sure enough the photos are stolen   I didn t tell this person the jig was up   I said send me a photo with today s newspaper  He photoshopped the correct New York Times front page with another of the stolen photos   Day   and today he is so in love with me he can t hide it any longer  Each fake photo he sends  he now puts the current date and a time stamp on it   I gave this person fake info to go with his fake info    I blocked the phone number today ,Negative
Reddit,Advice please,  Recently met someone online   me    her      we ve now had   dates   She s stunning and funny and has a real big personality and against the odds she seems to like me    Problem being   I don t have a big personality like her   I m quite a slow burner   I don t feel like I m enough   I actually feel a bit intimidated by her   which is a shit state of affairs I know     This is probably due to a lack of belief in myself    Ordinarily i might come up with a reason not to carry on but I really don t want too    I ve talked to family members about how I feel she s out of my league   they just tell me I m a great guy and I should just go with the flow    Perhaps I m not looking for advice   perhaps just a few words of encouragement just to stop me sending her some shit message that ends things   which I ll later regret     Thanks for reading ,Negative

Reddit,Should I just go for it ,Should I just go for it   I ve been texting a girl on and off for a few months  I never built the confidence to ask her on a date so the conversations we had were very brief  There were times were I could ve kept it going but just left her on read   As time passed I worked on myself mentally and physically  and now I m more confident  A few months ago I slid up on an instagram story with the worst pickup line of all time and I got left on delivered    Weeks passed and I messaged her again and she replied but when I tried making conversation she left me on delivered  This happened on   occasions    I m wondering if I should just straight up ask her if she wants to go for drinks whenever she s free    I feel like she thinks I m just wasting her time with countless meaningless convos  so I think a more straightforward approach is better  but I d like your opinion on this ,Positive

Reddit,Keyword search ,Hi daters   I    M  met my ex on match in       and sadly that didn t last   I am divorcing  and have  sandbox  accounts on Facebook Dating  match and pof - in  take a break  or with profiles made invisible while I look around   I don t think that I will date before my divorce is final  but it might depend on how slow things are   I m pretty disconnected and healthy  but I know I m not done   Something I used to use on multiple sites was a keyword search   Instead of poring over every profile  I would search for who talked about hiking  or biking  or whatever  so that I could prioritize those women   I don t see that anywhere so far   Match was always bad at revamping their whole damned UI every couple of months and it looks like they tossed that feature in a purge   And with the swipe model  which I barely touched back in the day   I wonder if any major site or app has keyword search these days   Has anyone seen this lately ,Negative
Reddit,Ghosting sucks,Why do people do it  Had a match ghost me before we could finish setting up a date she agreed to originally  Everything seemed well  texting on and off all day  Then poof  If you re not interested  just tell that person  Think about the other person  I had   matches besides her  even   likes  Really my only hope and I was being gaslighted into thinking something could actually turn out  It sucks  How do you go back to the app with   likes and start swiping again  It s such a morale killer  Don t have the time to be going to places to meet people  nor do I have the skills or patience for it  Clearly I don t have the patience for this either  ,Negative
Reddit,First experience  ,So my wife is divorcing me after    years so I put my info pictures on an online site but didn t pay then this woman tags me so after a few days I finally paid to read her message and respond as I d already seen her pictures and profile  Well after just a couple of messages we made a simple bike riding date  It was fabulous  We made such a nice connection   I ve seen her again and another date is planned  It s like too good to be true ,Positive
Reddit,Pig Butchering  Are other women being targeted ,Recently me     year old female  jumped back on Tinder and had conversations with over    guys from different European countries who now claim to live in my city      These guys are always talking about cryptocurrency  even though I ve made it clear that I have no interest in it  They also have pictures that appear genuine  but I couldn t find any matches when I did a reverse image search       While they do bring up other topics  cryptocurrency always seems to be the main focus  Some have asked me to invest  and I am very clear that i will never invest in a date   I m wondering if this is a common scam where men with questionable English skills are hired to deceive desperate women or if they are independent scammers     Evrery single time I ask them about pig butchering and they stop talking to me  am I the only one being targetted by these men ,Negative
Reddit,Does anyone else not have social media ,I deactivated facebook  I never got into instagram  and I briefly downloaded Snapchat when matches kept asking for my snap but I have since deleted the app from my phone when I stopped using dating apps    I find a lot of people expect you to at least have an instagram so they can see more about you  more pictures  what you re about  who you follow  etc  I m embarrassed to start instagram because I d have no followers which would make me look like a red flag  It s frustrating because I don t want to have to use social media to get people to like me  Why isn t messaging on the dating app itself enough for most people ,Negative

Reddit,Do you keep the sporadic conversations going or focus on engaged people ,I    M  can t not notice that almost everyone I ve ever slept with or even kissed from OLD was a breeze to talk to and meet  Engaged conversation in text  no big pauses  has time to meet right that week  no reschedules  just acting like a person who actually wants to see me  Very rarely I could turn a bad situation around and get a girl out who forgot to reply for a week  but they ended up being uninterested in person too  So it looks like     of my results come from     of the effort   I m thinking if a girl matches me and they take   days to reply to my first text  or they reply once a day every day  or they disappear for a week and re-emerge  I ll just cut all of them off  I know I m gonna lose a small fraction of people who just happened to have a tough few days  but are actually interested  But in reality  the first   texts look like a miraculously good indicator of how the rest of our story will go  Opinions ,Negative

Reddit,Dating slowly,Just a question  everyone seems to aim for the numbers game  Max amount of dates as possible  is it just me or does that sound awful to anyone else  I have enough energy for like maybe   dates a month  When i find someone and start talking to them  i just talk to them and maybe   other person and straight up ignore everyone else stop swiping all together cuz i cant handle multiple conversations  I seriously dont have the energy for it even if i  know  statistically itl just take me longer to find someone cuz most dates turn into rejection  Does anyone else feel the same level of not really caring to max out your week with dates ,Negative

Reddit,Is anyone else noticing more and more people using AI photos for their profiles ,I m not talking about scammers bots btw  I m talking legitimate profiles  They ll usually have a mix-profile starts with a very obvious AI photo of themselves and then a couple real pics of themselves  I m seeing this occur more and more with mens profiles  how often is this happening on the womens side     It s just really off-putting and weird imo  Like do they not realize we know  Is it an attempt to look  cool  ,Negative
Reddit,Stating that I don t want man-haters on my profile,I ve been on Hinge for a short while  and saw a couple of profiles of women being a bit too comfortable saying they disliked men   I don t like this mentality  so I just added a prompt basically saying to fuck off if you were the kind of spreading hatred towards men  I didn t say it like that though  I worded it much more politely and stated that I was looking for positive people    I m curious to know if other people did the same thing  whether you re male or female   And if so  did it affected your matches positively  or even negatively    EDIT   Yeah  I removed the prompt and replaced it by something more positive  in this case  that I was attracted to older girls  ,Positive

Reddit,If the very  st message is asking to meet up does that mean they just want sex ,Yesterday I made a post about generic profiles that got a bit heated and inspired this post   For context    I get a lot of opening messages from guys who simply ask  shall we go for a drink    As do most women on apps   I m not a prude nor do I really want to spend much time texting mindlessly  But it always puts me off if they don t ask me any questions before asking to meet up    It come across they don t have anything better to do than meet up with a stranger and get laid  At least by asking questions you can suss out whose looking for fun or whose looking for substance   The same way I want to see if someone is worth meeting up with I want the other person to have some standards that go beyond look  Please  if you feel comfortable state whether you re F M ,Neutral

Reddit,Too close to home,I just swiped a little and saw someone I found interesting but the distance scared me off  It was less than a mile away    On one hand I think getting to know someone who lives that close to me could end awkward  On the other hand that s how lots of people meet   I don t want to close myself off due to someone just being literally right in front of me   What is your experience getting to know people who live close by    saying  getting to know  instead of  dating  cause I feel like that is far fetched right now ,Positive
Reddit,I ve gotten no matches on Bumble since they removed the free compliments  Has anyone else had this issue ,I have gotten almost no matches for about a year  I ve noticed a year ago bumble took awhile the   compliments every    hours or so option  and now you can t send any compliments without paying  Through swiping I get no matches  However  on facebook dating or meetme or dating sites where you can message  I ll at least get some matches  Idk if I m shadow banned on the site or what  Or if I should pay for compliments  Make a new profile  Any suggestions  and has anyone else noticed the same thing that they have gotten no matches since Bumble removed the compliment message option ,Negative
Reddit,What apps sites have higher amounts of conservative women ,God forbid I claim to be a one on Reddit  but I grew up in a conservative area and currently live in a more liberal county due to when I was finishing up college and work  I ve tried most of the major apps and no surprise  it s like     of women are liberal  I know that more women in general are liberal than not  anyways   I m    M  I just want someone who shares some values as me  Or at least doesn t really care about politics  I absolutely could not date someone with mostly all opposing views as me   I m usually told  go meet women at church  or told to cold approach women in public  I don t go to church and cold approaching seems a little creepy  IMO  I also don t do clubs nor bars solo not my scene  I ll go drinking with a friend now and then but that s infrequent   As such  it feels like dating apps are my best bet  which is extremely unfortunate  Which have the highest amounts of conservative women  Besides Christian Mingle  probably  I d still consider myself a very loose Christian but religion has never been that huge in my life  Also I thought that site was for people like     tbh   Or at least apps that let you filter by political views for free like Bumble on PC ,Negative
Reddit,Tinder Gold -        a WEEK ,Who is paying    bucks a WEEK for Tinder  Or you can upgrade to a month for the low price of     a week  At   months it s    a week aka     a month   Is  anyone  actually paying these prices  I d think   bucks is a month is fair for the minimal features Tinder Gold gives you ,Negative
Reddit,Does Facebook Dating show the person themselves as a mutual friend ,Weirdly have come across someone I m friends with on Facebook dating  however under the mutual friends section  it shows them as a mutual friend   Is this a thing  Or a glitch  Or is someone they re friends with pretending to be them ,Negative
Reddit,Men  it s insane competition  Saw first hand last night with lady friend and I making profiles at same time ,Me and my female acquaintance made Bumble profiles simultaneously when we were bored at a work gathering last night   I m     she is     so that may be a factor but still it is insane   This morning at breakfast  she asked me how many likes I received overnight   I had       Thought I was doing great   She shows me her phone      likes  In less than    hours while people are normally sleeping         So men  that is what you are up against  Honestly seeing this makes me surprised I ever get a response from women  Basically a full time job for them sorting through the men ,Negative
Reddit,Girl says I don t seem engaged in the conversation  Do I just forget it ,Matched with a girl   weeks ago and hit it off immediately  We live two hours apart but had a ton of convo on Hinge and then moved to text  I ve been trying to set up a date but she s in med school and super busy  which I understand  Tentatively have something set up for     when I ll be in her area    I almost always text her first in the morning even though she gets up before me  Nbd  Generally we text a few times throughout the day and then a lot late in the evenings when she is done with her studies  On Wednesday we had more texting than usual  meaning like   straight hours vs   hour  and she said it made her night  On Saturday night we also had a ton of texting  On Sunday I didn t text her between       and     pm  and then she never texted me but I texted her again at       was watching the football games     Anyways  we went back and forth on a couple things and she says  doesn t seem like there s much to chat about anymore  You don t seem engaged at all so is there a point    I m thinking - you could have also texted me if you wanted to chat during the   hours between your text and mine or the   hours between my two texts    Also thinking - does every day have to have     texts going back and forth to make it a worthwhile day of engagement    Literally the day before this she s calling me babe and borderline sexting  Then   hours of no messaging means I am no longer engaged and there s nothing to talk about  Okay   Guess maybe I am dodging something here if this is her maturity level or communication needs  I was already trying to figure out when I could see her in person and if it lead to an actual relationship  how I could ever go on dates more than every other week at best with her insane school schedule  But really strange how she has to have constant contact or she feels like I m no longer interested in her    Am I off base here and this is normal or does she just have strange communication needs  Insecurity on her part ,Negative
Reddit,Worried about saying wrong things over text and making things awkward,I always regret sending texts whenever the girl doesn t respond back  I start to think that maybe I said something weird  asked something she didnt understand and it just caused her to stop responding due to the awkwardness or her not knowing how to respond   Usually I try to reach back out weeks later to restart a whole new conversation  but most of the time she just disappears for good and I never hear back  I think that maybe the text miscommunication mistake I made earlier caused her to lose interest  Anybody face this issue too and how to get over that mindset  Or am I just overthinking,Negative

Reddit,Facebook Dating Issues,This is a dumb question  but ever since Facebook Dating rolled out  I ve been curious about trying it out  Problem is  I ve never been able to access it  All my friends have  and my primary partner  we re poly  has been able to  as well  I ve read up on all the possible reasons it isn t available   It s only available in certain countries  I m in the US  and everyone I know has been able to access it  so it s definitely not that    You have you be      I am well over     and my profile reflects that   You have to be using the app  I am   Turn your location services on  I did   Turn your notifications on  I did   Delete the app  restart your phone  reinstall the app  I did    Any other reason I wouldn t be able to access it  ,Negative
Reddit,Should I Keep Pursuing This ,So I    f  met a guy on a dating app    m  he sent me a message and I responded  We hit it off immediately  We had so much in common even my more niche interests  He was funny  sweet and just seemed like the shy cute nerdy type  Which is my type  Now we started texted kind of irregularly on my part due to life but still pretty consistently  Even if I took forever to respond he was patient and kind  Now fast forward to about a month and a half later  Still talking  We finally breech the subject of exs and sexual partners  I decide it s about time to confess  I am a virgin and I m asexual  Now I am a sex interested asexual but none the less asexual  My drive is very low as I don t experience sexual attraction like other people  I decide to just lay it all out there  I have very little dating experience on top of no experience in sex as well  He takes it all well  In fact he gets kind of excited about my confession saying I m rare and it s amazing  Which strikes me as odd  He questions me a bit on the asexual part and I just tell him the truth of everything  All in all he takes everything well  However this is where stuff starts to kind of turn  After this conversation he stays kind of tame but makes little semi sexual flirts and jokes that I don t really mind  But then he makes a comment about how I couldn t handle more  I ask what he means and then that really changes the way our conversations go  He begins sexting me  asking very sexual personal questions and talking about the very graphic things he d like to do  Now I must say I didn t really mind all of this at first  It was kind of fun  I m fine with some sexy conversation but that s pretty much all our conversations are now  And I have made it very clear multiple times that for me I need a strong emotional connection before I could actually be physical  Don t get me wrong we have very strong sexual chemistry at least from what I can tell lol Just because I don t have experience doesn t mean I don t have some idea of what I ll like and he ticks every box in that department  We have a lot of kinks in common though his are a little more intense than mine and he definitely has more  However I kind of feel like that s all we have  We are lacking in conversation and connection outside of that and I want to bring it up and try to work on that  However there have been a couple red flags that make me think that I should just give up  Firstly I don t like that he keeps pushing more and more sexual stuff onto me and that he almost seems like that s all he s interested in but before all of this he was so sweet and asked me lots of questions but now nothing  Secondly I kind of feel like he likes that I m a virgin because he can kind of  train  me to fit his more extreme kinks  I m not sure that s just kind of the vibe I get  And the last thing is he is in the mood like all the time  and has been pressuring me a lot to send him nudes which I am not comfortable with at all and have expressed that  But now I don t even know how to keep saying no so I just kind of say I will when I m more comfortable  At this point I don t know what to do there are so many things I like about him but it almost feels like I like who he pretended to be and the person he is now is just interested in sleeping with me    I want to also add that at this point we have been talking for   months and I just realized I think he thinks we are in a relationship  which we are not  He has asked but I said it s still too soon and dropped other little hints if he mentioned it  I wanted to follow the three month rule  And one other things that is concerning for me is he is very adamant that he wants children in the future and I have been very adamant that I do not ever want children  He said we could talk about it again in the future  But it kind of makes me nervous because if we did keep talking and eventually sleeping together he doesn t want to use protection and then what if something happens  I can just see a lot of possible problems  But I also have a fearful avoidant attachment style so sometimes I don t know if I m just in my head too much ,Negative 
Reddit,Very confused    I  M    was rejected for being           ,Chatted with this girl after matching for a full day  Normally I don t chat that much before meeting up  but the conversation was flowing really well     we had a lot in common  and she even wanted to meet up that night  Anyways  after all of this she says  Can I ask a question   I said  Sure  and she asked me my height  I said         She didn t look super tall or anything  She was maybe       or        After I answered her question  she instantly unmatched me    I couldn t believe it  Would a girl that short really care if I m not taller than         Do girls like that exist  I honestly don t care  but it surprised the hell out of me  LMAO ,Negative
Reddit,What is everyone s biggest challenge problem with online dating  And what  if anything  is going well ,I straight male live in a big city  am over     and get quality matches on apps - as measured by appearance  professional academic background  and well-roundedness    But I find very few people I match with seem to be interested in something more serious  let alone a second date  I question how much is me - like I show well on a profile  but don t impress in the same way on a date  Versus how much the basic realities of dating at my age - i e  many people who are  quality  and never married by     having impossibly high standards  avoidant tendencies  lack of interest in LT partnerships  etc   So for me  the positive is that the app is doing what it s supposed to - connecting me to people I meet IRL  The downside is I m not getting the outcomes I want    What is everyone else experiencing  either negative or positive  ,Positive
Reddit,Pausing dating app,Just wondering if you guys have any advice on this    I was talking to a few girls on dating apps and went on a few dates  I matched with someone recently and went on an amazing date where we both felt our goals aligned plus the chemistry was definitely there too    Do I pause my dating profile   Should I let my matches know I found someone and want to pursue the relationship  Especially those I already hooked up with       Any advice would be appreciated,Positive
Reddit,Why do some people WANT to know about number of past sex partners ,I made this post because the previous one about this topic was locked  but anyways I never understood when some people ask or volunteer info about number of sex partners in the past   intimate details about sexual encounters  what age they lost their virginity  etc    I ve only had a few girls ask about that stuff and the few who did were kinda crazy  Like they d ask or share that info on or before a first date and maybe I m in the minority but I m like um  why are you asking sharing this  Like whether someone s been with   person or    people before me  I still don t wanna know that stuff  And I think it s just as odd for guys to do this too  For example  a friend of mine in the past she had a date with this guy who bragged about  an awesome threesome  he had to her  Like wtf  why would you share that with someone you re potentially trying to date  especially that early on  About   years ago  I also had a girl tell me about how she recently had a pregnancy test and was worried about how she was pregnant  And also had an abortion  Don t get me wrong  I m      pro choice  but also that doesn t mean I wanna hear the details specifics  especially on a first date   I just feel like these types of conversations never end well  regardless of what the answers are  Usually the person asking is either insecure or maybe judgmental   It s like that scene in Clerks where Veronica flips out on Dante for sleeping with    girls and he flips out for her sucking    dicks      x   B ,Negative
Reddit,Get no matches on Hinge but I get lots on other apps,So I am not sure whether it is me or Hinge  I use Tinder  OkCupid and Hily and a couple of other niche ones and in total I have LOTS of matches  I decided to give Hinge a try but in a few days I have only gotten one match with a girl  I put my preferences to everyone out of curiosity and I get inundated with shit loads of these dudes giving me roses or whatever the Hinge thing is called  I am so confused  Hinge always shoves this boost and subscription feature in my face   To use Hinge  do you truly need to boost yourself subscribe to it  My profile is not bad far from great but it sees a lot of success in other apps  What gives  ,Negative
Reddit,When setting a time and place for a date feels like jumping through hoops,When she says she isnt available and it seems hard to nail down a time and place for a date  do you feel that it increases the chances of the girl ghosting  Especially when she doesn t offer alternatives or help make it easier for you to meet up with her in person  I m pretty direct and specific about date and time  so it does work for the most part  But for some girls  when she doesn t say yes the first time   it feels like a mistake that can t be reverted and now she s gonna lose interest  I feel like the more  hurdles  and obstacles that come up when trying to set up plans to meet  she ll stop responding and just disappear  It almost feels as if you screwed up trying to ask her out  Then I think  maybe I should ve just stayed penpals  Anybody else experienced this too  Any tips on how to avoid these situations ,Negative
Reddit,How long to give myself to figure out my feelings ,So  I ve    F  had   dates with a guy    M  I met irl then later matched with on bumble  I like him  he s very nice  I enjoy spending time with him and talking to him  he s incredibly interesting and makes me laugh  I also find him extremely physically attractive  However  I m not sure how strongly I feel about him  and I m not sure if this is a case where chemistry may build over time  or I m just not feeling it  or maybe I rushed myself into this situation  as I got out of a short  couple of months  and very intense relationship about a month and a half ago   I don t want to waste his time or hurt him if I can avoid it  he seems to be very into me and  as much as I like him  I m not there yet  I am wondering how much time is reasonable to give myself to figure out if I will get there  He is aware that I got out of a relationship not that long ago  and has been incredibly kind and patient and let me take the lead on boundaries and physical affection and hasn t been pushy at all  all we ve done is hug   It s really wonderful  he s really wonderful  I m trying to take it date by date  and my friends are encouraging me to just see what happens  I feel like I just don t really know how to date  maybe  I have only really been trying to date since late September  before that I d been in a couple of long term relationships with people I met irl ,Neutral
Reddit,Pros and cons of matching and potentially dating someone who is religious ,A few days ago I matched with a girl on hinge who I could tell was religious based on what she wrote in her prompts  but I gave it a go and we talked on the phone for a bit last night  mainly because the weather had been cold and rainy the previous few days   I thought the call went well as we talked about different topics  but I did notice a lot of times during the call she mentioned about her faith and how she is always doing stuff with church etc  Anyways today she messaged me that she thought we wouldn t be a good match because she prefers someone who is very religious like her  and that was fine being though I have my own faith I am not not super religious like I guess she preferred   So today I noticed on hinge and bumble now of religious girls popping up to match with  So my question to everyone out of curiosity is what are some pros or cons to potentially dating someone who is I guess really religious ,Neutral
Reddit,How common is it for people to ask others to email them a dating proposal ,Every now and then I ll come across profiles that ask others to email them a dating proposal in one of their prompts like this  https   imgur com BA ffq    At first I thought it was a one off thing  but I ve been seeing an uptick in profiles asking for this  Someone told me it was a TikTok trend  Is this a common thing people do now   For reference  I m a   M and I ve been seeing this a lot on Hinge  but I ve seen it a couple times on Bumble as well ,Positive
Reddit,I went from weekly dates in Austin to hardly any in Atlanta  Is the scene just tougher out here ,Hinge is my primary app and I went from  -  matches each week to  -  in Atlanta  I thought when I moved out here that I would have more success as a black man since there is a lot more black people here  but I was dead wrong    Is the competition just more fierce out here  Is anyone else struggling in the dating scene in Atlanta  ,Negative
Reddit,I do this weird thing to increase the amount of people seeing me  does this actually work ,What I do is I go on the app in the morning and swipe once so that I appear as  active today  then in the afternoon when most people are using the app I do the rest of my swiping  Am I overthinking it ,Positive
Reddit,Why is every app full of east asian girls  desperate to get you on whatsapp and how are they verified ,I ve had this   times today  I match out of the misguided belief that one of them  might be real  and it d be a shame to miss out on a pretty girl just because you assume she s a bot   Now  I ignore the blatant obvious fake profiles  but the ones you do talk to  they re desperate to get you on whatsapp but even after this  it never really goes anywhere  It s not like they straight up ask for credit card details  the conversation is like talking to a bot at times  but sometimes it feels more genuine    What s the angle here  and how are they verified  Ive started using bloom  on account of being banned from pretty much everything else for no reason  and they use a video verification where you have to move your head around like it says  and if it doesnt work it can be manually reviewed   I m aware of the pig butcher scam and all the other things  but thing is  none of these profiles over the years have ever actually tried to scam me  Am I that ugly that I m not even worth scamming   D  What gives ,Negative
Reddit,Recommendations for Free Dating Accounts,Recently got into online dating and started with eHarmony with a free account  While I don t have issues with the site per se  I m not crazy about some of the stuff stuck behind a paywall  I m curious how the basic account compares with others   I wanted to ask if there were any recommendations for other apps  specifically their free low cost tier offerings  I can respect the argument for paid accounts deterring scams  but a lot of the prices I ve seen are ridiculous  ,Neutral
Reddit,First time a women   f is fully reciprocating and I m getting nervous   m - online dating, Let me start of by saying I have zero dating experience  I ve been on dates but haven t been in a relationship before and it s made me miserable from the inside  A lot of insecurity about it ngl  So I start using this app to improve my second language and I messaged a lot of girls to just get myself more comfortable talking with them and I messaged this one girl who looked cute on her profile pic   Our convo was pretty basic but I reached out a lot to her and she asked if I had instagram which I replied no and offered my snap and we added each other there to start talking  She responded so quickly to my snaps and the flow of the convo was great  a few dull moments but I figure that s normal she s human too   We talked about everything really  After about  ish days talking things start picking up and we started flirting   This is the first time I ve had a girl desire me almost more than I desire her  In all honesty  she s so beautiful it s hard to believe it  She is so infactuated by my looks that she was slam dunking me with compliments  She said she d fall for my charm if we saw each other in person and how beautiful my smile was and just so many other things that I just started to freeze inside  I ve never had a girl openly desire me like this and it s making me nervous   I fully reciprocated despite my nervousness  She sent me a pic of herself in her bed without makeup and she still lit up the room  She was insecure before sending it and apologized for not wearing makeup  Long story short  she sent me a final message tonight saying she had to go to bed  lives in a different time zone  but said I could send her more pics of me if I want for her to see when she wakes up and she wished me a good night with a kiss face  She never used emojis when we initially started talking and she came off as stoic in the beginning   She told me she s dated   guys in her life and said the first two she was young and I don t remember about the last one  Am I over my head in this situation  Checks out she s not fake also so no worries regarding that she s a real girl lol,Positive
Reddit,How many dates without sex before you decide they ve  wasted your time  ,Maybe I m just bitter  but I get this sense that a lot of guys treat first date conversation as foreplay  a necessary evil  or a way to determine whether she is high status enough that he ll not feel ashamed about sleeping with her  Even the  nice  ones who come off as respectful and say all the politically correct things  Now that I have a certain number of bad experiences under my belt  I don t want to get physical with someone until trust and friendship is firmly established  But it seems no one wants to make the investment to get to know someone  You gotta test drive the car asap so you can move to the next one if there isn t  chemistry   never mind that trust is key to chemistry    Update  Thanks to those in the comments who ve made it clear that a lot of guys really do think this way  No more apps for me  I ll meet people irl where you can read nonverbal cues and aren t already on a date with them the first time you see them  These online dating rules and rituals are absurd ,Negative
Reddit,Is double texting really a red flag ,Ok  here s the situation  Nothing crazy in depth  talking to my match for the past few days  Maybe  -  texts at most per day  I opened up talking about an interest we share I saw on her profile  Last night I sent my last response  and I m looking at it now thinking I kind of left it close off  not open for an answer if that makes sense    I know the idea is to get off rhe apps asap  and I wanna try to do that at thus point  She obviously hasn t responded since  which I understand not everybody has      availability  Just the only match I really have rn  and I think she s cute and shares the same ideals on her profile  I want to send a message telling her that  A like  Hey I think ur cute  do you have a   sc so we can keep talking and set something up   Is this a bad idea    Sorry  I m not good at this stuff  Still young and very inexperienced  I m sure this has been discussed on this sub before  but couldn t find anything  so bear with me   ,Negative
Reddit,He asked for a hookup and I said no but kind of regret it,Met a guy online and we ve chatted for about a day but he s going to be out of town for a while  so is looking for something casual and told me so  Basically asked me whether I would be interested in hooking up  I m looking for something long-term but was on the fence still when he asked because he ticks a lot of the boxes I look for in a guy and so I would be curious meet him  But I turned his offer down because I had a bad experience with getting intimate with someone else too soon  although at least this guy was being honest about what he wanted   He said ok and said if I wanted to meet up somewhere late evening instead to let him know  late evening because I work in the evenings   Probably won t end up happening since I m also wary of meeting people for the first time late at night  and I feel disappointed since I ve had little luck recently with OLD in terms of even getting a guy to respond and don t know if I really made the right choice even though rationally I think I did   Also wondering if I should ask this guy if he d be interested in staying in touch or something even while he s away  Or ask about letting me know if he s interested in meeting up when he s back   Edit  Thank you to the people who offered advice ,Negative
Reddit,Is this a red flag   ,I met this guy online and everything has been going great  We have many things in common  he s smart  caring and funny  We haven t met in person yet but we had a video call which also went pretty good  We were texting the other day and I told him that I normally can tell how a person is by looking at them in the eye  then he proceeded to send me a photo of himself in the shower with his shirt off and looking straight to the camera  It felt a bit off and then he asked me if he was making me uncomfortable  then I said no  and he proceeded to send me a photo of his entire body but to the point that you can almost see his private parts  Then I told him that I would have prefer the first photo and not the second photo  since I like to take things slowly  He said  Alright  He also sometimes makes comments very subtle about us doing stuff together in the future  like going together to the Alps  I want to know if I m overreacting  ,Negative
Reddit, I m focusing on you  what does that mean  if we re not in a relationship ,So this guy and I matched and the first date was hot  but then I found out he s only looking for a fling while I wanted a relationship  so I said maybe this wouldn t work out   We still talked and I was thinking internally that maybe it wouldn t be so bad to have a bit of fun because all life  I ve just had serious relationships and it was always so dramatic  Obviously he was still into me  otherwise he wouldn t be talking to me  I said I would be open to try out a fling   Ever since  we ve talked everyday  and have gone on two dates  three dates within a month so far  and a couple of times  he would ask me how my dating app game was going  I would say I m not using it much  and he would say the same thing and say   I m focusing on you now    For me  mentally  even if I m not in a relationship  I don t have the bandwidth to accommodate two or more guys at once  But I could see he was asking to know if he was just a notch on my belt  Whereas for him  I know he likely isn t seeing someone else  due to his schedule   but I can t be too sure he isn t swiping on apps  even if he did say he is  focusing on me    Which is what is concerning me  because I m starting to wish I was seeing someone who wants to have a relationship  This is fun  but I m     so I do think about marriage and stuff and he clearly has different career plans  so probably isn t thinking about marriage for a long time   I want to start looking out for other guys again  but I don t know what  focusing on me  means  A guy friend said it means this guy likes me and wants to be with me  but I don t know when he would want to commit  If I can find a man who wants to commit now  why wouldn t I focus my time and energy on him  instead of endlessly waiting for this guy   I don t know when to ask him if it s alright that I start looking out  because it feels like something I should ask in person  but it s like breaking up over a dinner  which is something I myself would not like   So basically my questions are  what does he mean by this statement  and when should I tell him I d rather start seeing other guys if he doesn t want to commit ,Negative
Reddit,Lack of connection,So  I have met a few guys from online dating apps  We have had lots of good chats - texting and voice note   When we have met in person  it s just so different  Getting to know someone via text is completely different to knowing them in person  in my opinion   Most of my dates haven t progressed past the first one    I d be interested to hear your thoughts on this if you relate   - ,Negative
Reddit, I don t know why I m even on here   ,Do people just say this on their bios because their egos can t handle having to resort to using apps to find dates or something ,Negative
Reddit,This is obviously a scam  right ,I leave a comment on somebody s photo on Hinge  About a day later  they match with me  replying only with a couple emotes  I ask them a question and they say they aren t on the app much and ask for some other way to communicate like a number    with formatting like this     Sorry Idon t check here often     if    you don tmind  leave a   of    yours    for bettercommunication  It s like a purposeful pattern  but one that nobody would actually write unless they were trying to be cute or reach a certain demographic  like in phishing scams   And considering it s the first thing they said to me and they didn t say their favorite thing is weird poetry that looks vaguely like a haiku  I m pretty sure it s not the  st one lol ,Negative
Reddit,Hinge,Do you have to pay to get or receive any messages  I can t seem to use hinge without hitting  a pay wall  is nothing on there free ,Negative
Reddit,Banned for nothing,Woke up this morning to find I was banned from Hinge  Thought it was surely a joke- I have no beef with anyone  nothing inappropriate  long term user and verified profile  Thought surely something got reported by mistake and I asked for appeal and it was denied   I m permabanned  I ve seen reports now that I m looking about this happening and how much their appeal process sucks and that they ll recognize me if I try to make a new profile  What do I do   Has anyone had this happen to them    I m on Bumble at least but   I just can t understand this  And can t fathom what I could ve done to warrant this  It s so frustrating that their support all seems to be automated and final ,Negative
Reddit,Fake Profiles,This just happened so I thought I d share  Matched with a lady on Hinge today and started chatting  I was suspicious at first cause her pictures were too perfect  But I m a sucker so my disbelief was suspended  Then I commented about the NFC AFC title games and her reply was strange and generic  Then she disappeared  She recently reappeared and when I asked her a question  her reply came in Chinese then she realized her mistake  unmatched and disappeared  I don t understand why there are fake Chinese people on Hinge ,Negative

Reddit,Ceasing conversations,So I m pretty new to online dating and have a history of people pleasing issues that make it difficult  I have to keep reminding myself I owe nothing to a stranger I met on the internet other than basic kindness  I matched with someone  we only messaged a few times but I was already pretty sure it wasn t a good match  He didn t understand a joke I made and then got mad about it for some reason  I sent him a message basically saying I wasn t feeling it and I hope he finds what he s looking for  That pissed him off  So what s the best way to stop talking to someone  Just unmatching seems a bit rude to me unless they said something offensive or creepy  What would you rather be on the receiving end of ,Neutral
Reddit,Should I give him my number ,So I ve been talking to this man for a few months now and he s asked me on a date and he wants to exchange numbers  We haven t met yet    I really like him and he s been so sweet  and I feel comfortable getting to know him more  If it goes south I can block him right    Am I overthinking or is it too soon   Any advice would be great ,Neutral
Reddit,What is your success rate after the other person reschedules ,I ve been on OLD for many years and had several dozen first dates  My cold hard stats  after a girl reschedules  the chance of us ever meeting again is about      and the chance that we re gonna have anything happen between us is practically nil  even if I manage to take her out after a reschedule  I reckon this is due to the fact that a reschedule implies she isn t too interested and she also doesn t respect my time   A shocking bonus fact  many people advise that I should be ok if she is very proactive in setting up another date  or she only postpones to tomorrow  My experience is that this doesn t change the stats  As soon as she types the word  reschedule   our fate is sealed   My data includes excuses like sickness  sudden work assignments  tiredness  sleepiness etc  People are also very protective of sickness as a good excuse but all girls who got  sick  before our date ended up never meeting me after   What are your stats  I m not asking about the one exception where your neighbor met his wife this way  I m asking general stats  Because I m kinda ready to conclude that at this point when I read the word reschedule  I ask no questions  negotiate nothing  just unmatch right away ,Negative
Reddit,Everytime I match with a guy  we talk  then they just seem to shut me out ,Last night I matched with this guy on Okcupid  and we were talking about meeting up  just for a hookup  We even exchanged numbers  But for some reason  like five minutes later  he blocks me  I don t hear anything back  A couple hours later  I decided to match with a guy who sent me a message on Bumble  we talked for about an hour  but we couldn t meet up because neither of us had a ride  and it was a four and a half hour walk  I gave him my number  and we agreed to meet up in the morning  since the buses would be back up  I check on him in the morning  since I forgot to turn on Bumble s notifications  and he ended our chat  Am I doing something wrong  Why do people keep blocking me ,Negative
Reddit,Why do so many Chinese ladies change their location to my city , I swipe right  we match  and guess what  Their profile says they actually live in Thailand or the Philippines  There s no chance I m going to fly to one of the Chinese countries just for a date  Is there a way to avoid this      x   B ,Negative

Reddit,Is  open minded  just code for sex hook ups ,Title  What are your thoughts  Guy I was supposed to see said he wanted a serious relationship  Day before our date  he s asking me if we can go to his house for sex  we ve already unmatched but I remember he used the word  open minded  in his profile when he was talking about some qualities he looks for  I m not looking for sex on the first date or hook ups so I m wondering if I should avoid anyone who uses this in their profile  I feel every time I see that term it alludes to sex    Obligatory I know not EVERYONE who uses that term just wants sex but I m wondering if the majority do ,Negative
Reddit,How are dating sites apps worth so much money ,After watching a clip of the founders of Coffee Meets Bagel turn down     million in cash on Shark Tank which was shocking to me  I was also shocked to learn it s current Net Worth is      million dollars and it generates     million in revenue annually  It doesn t seem to do anything quite different than other dating apps and quite frankly from my and other friends experience  it would seem it has the same disappointing experience for the average man  Studies show that women only match with the top    of men on dating apps  I don t even know how dating apps make a lot of money  Most guys who pay for premium services would quit after a month or   of no matches and women don t need to pay for matches  Plus I and most guys I know have given up on dating apps and deleted from their phones  How are dating apps still doing so well  Is it just relying on a constant stream of new guys who pay for a few months of premium before quitting ,Negative
Reddit,How to cancel a date,I ve met someone online and he seems really nice but I ve realised I m not ready for anything yet  We have never met but have a date planned for tomorrow  I don t want to waste any more of his time so how can I tell him  nicely without seeming like I don t care ,Neutral
Reddit,Leaving  are we dating the same guy ,There s been some post about this  but it s been several months ago  The last few days I decided to leave these groups because I noticed these patterns that just keep appearing over and over and it s the same women who did the same men and it s all just some weird immature game   When you look at these women s profiles who post these guys they have heavily filtered photos of themselves  They are so not even being real with themselves    And then I just got so disgusted  If I heard one more we matched  we are chatting  or  he has been posted before    I am literally going to barf   I m embarrassed that I ever even joined the groups in the first place  I am also embarrassed that I ever even signed up for online dating and dating apps in the first place as well   These groups just exposed  how toxic the entire dating app industry is  A lot of people don t realize that Tinder etc  was started by so-called incels who are incredible coders app developers   who never got any play and decided this is a great way for me to get some pussy   It s taking me a very long time to realize this because I was so caught up in it  but I have absolutely no desire anymore to be part of these groups or even dating apps  Anyway  that s just my rant for the day   if anyone is thinking of getting out of this mess  this is your sign ,Negative
Reddit,Inviting a person back to your place ,So I m  f   new to online dating and I m extremely careful  one of the girls my family used to babysit was murdered and met her murderer off tinder so I m super sketched out anyway  but I met this guy one day and went to an arcade which was a blast  but now he wants to come to my house this weekend and it turned me off  Is that a typical expectation  I don t like someone I barely know coming to my house seeing where my kids sleep  etc but my friends are saying I m paranoid    Thanks ,Negative
Reddit, I want to see more photos of you  and then ghosting,Lol I never understood this thing that some women tend to do  They will get your phone number  and will ask you to send them more pictures of yourself to confirm if you re a  catfish   Lol  this happened to me  I sent the girl some pictures that weren t my best per say  nothing unappealing though  It s just that my best photos are on Hinge   and then she ghosted me after having some pretty good convos beforehand   I understand the whole online dating thing is superficial because you are literally judging people off their photos  but asking me for more photos and then ghosting me is hilarious lmaooo  Like I literally look like the same guy  Idk  I never understood this phenomenon because as a man  I only have so few good pictures  I get told I look better in person all the time lol  But honestly  I think she just had a ton of dudes hitting her up and wanted to find a way to weed somebody out lol  Only logical solution I can think of at least ,Negative

Reddit,When you match with someone and message them  how long are you willing to wait for a first response from them ,There are no right or wrong answers here  I m just curious about the different views and thoughts on it    With me personally  it tends to be at least    hours    After matching  I  almost always  immediately say hi and mention what I liked in their profile  and ask about something related to it  I only try to talk to a maximum of three people at a time to avoid social burnout  In that regard  I definitely appreciate quality over quantity  but also don t want to waste precious time   I was wondering how long others here wait before giving up and unmatching  What are your reasons for either unmatching or sticking around for a while ,Neutral

Reddit,Explanation on how The League works ,So I joined The League s waitlist last week  didn t really start looking through the app until today  I m not really sure how it works still what I m mainly wondering is  when have I well and truly joined the dating pool  Does that require you to be a paid member  or is it when you get off the waitlist   Also  can someone explain how I jumped multiple thousands of spots up the waitlist in a day  It says I m    globally and locally now is it a visual glitch ,Neutral
Reddit,Am I in a minority for wanting to skip the BS ,So I ve had a lot of potential dates  But I tend to blow it  I don t like texting  I find it fake  easy to miscommunicate  and time consuming  So usually request to  atleast  video chat within the first couple messages    If not actually meet for coffee or something    I ve noticed some will block me right after I ask that   like  isn t that why your on here  to meet someone       My logic  the fact that we matched should be enough to go on a casual date   Texting is pointless because anyone can  pretend  over text   I have wasted too much time  texting  potential online dates and now have a phone book full of people I never met before  so yeah either hang out or FaceTime until comfortable  Doesn t sound unreasonable to me       ,Negative
Reddit,How to approach this girl about a relationship ,I    m  matched with a girl on hinge about   weeks ago  Since then we have been texting every day  FaceTimed multiple times and even went on a date  On our date we even talked for   hours and I really felt a connection  Unfortunately she moved back to school last week so I won t see her for a while  We still text and FaceTime all the time but she never flirts with me or anything when talking  Its like talking to a friend in a way  which isn t what I want  Again  we only went out once bc she left for school so I don t think I should expect anything from her  But why does she still want to text and FaceTime often  What should I do in this situation  any advice would be useful ,Neutral
Reddit,Why do people just accept a like or match and not initiate conversation ,I don t understand  is that how the online dating world is   If you like someone s profile  they like back and that s it  Are they expecting the other person to always to start the conversation- the person who liked them first  Am I the only one who is finding this odd    As a very normal  ordinary looking women I find that strange  if someone doesn t like you and not interested then just don t match or unmatch if clicked by mistake     Talking about a non bumble world ,Negative
Reddit,How can I be less boring with messages ,I    m  do not usually get a lot of matches  but I got   last week    I tried different approaches in messaging but I feel I am too boring  I will always ask a question after responding to their question  I also tried asking for a date in my second or third message  I also tried changing the intervals in which I respond  e g   responding right away  waiting   minutes  waiting an hour or longer    None of the above has helped keep interest  Looking back at my messages  I think I just respond in an awkward way  that s why I try to lock in a date quick  But this also scares off people    Does anyone have tips on how to keep people interested or be less boring over text but not too pushy or needy ,Negative
Reddit,Would this be too creepy ,I live in a very rural area  circles are small  even if you don t know someone  you probably know somebody that does know them or they know someone that knows them   I joined POF awhile ago again  to maybe try to date again   Not a lot has caught my interest   Even though I don t pay  they have the blurred photos when someone  viewed and liked you   and being there aren t many choices on there locally  I can pretty much tell most of the profiles that did that from the local profiles   One gal has caught my eye  and she has  viewed and liked  me a couple times the past few months I have been on there  problem is  she has disabled messages   By chance  I noticed we have a mutual  friend  on Facebook   This  friend   we aren t close  she is actually just someone I took out one time and we never went anywhere   Edit  For clarification  the gal from POF commented on one of this friend s posts  that s how I saw her profile on FB   Would it be creepy if I reached out  respectfully  explained why I was messaging through there  and struck up a conversation   I m worried I ll come off as stalkerish or a guy that just randomly messages women on Facebook to try and hook up ,Neutral
Reddit,Pickup lines or formal greetings ,When I am swiping through these dating apps and get a few matches  I will usually say something along the lines of    Hey  How are you    Goodmorning        ask about something on their profile   I rarely get a response but when I do it s boring  dry  one word  one sided conversation    What are some strategies you guys use to get more communication from women on dating apps   Ratio - Match with       respond     completed,Negative
Reddit,Possible scam ,About a week ago  I matched with a girl from FB dating  We went from fb messaging to messaging on instagram  she did ask for either WhatsApp or insta     days into texting  she asked permission if we could video chat  I figured why not  it s also for security purposes and to make sure it s not some old dude behind the screen  She does look like what she shared on her profile  So far  so good right  Now here s the questionable part     days into texting and she managed to worked crypto into the conversation  Saying how she s both trading in crypto on the side while working full time  Cool  more income sources the better  But then she tried to convince me to get into crypto  She showed me how much she made and was doing her  sales pitch  on why crypto is good   She sent links from crypto com and she ll guide me step by step  Luckily I didn t clicked any links she sent  I managed to talk her down and said I m not interested in it    On day    she brings up crypto again and I again shot her down  Then she went on full guilt tripping text about how I wasnt capitalizing on this opportunity to make more money and not willing to learn new stuff  This raises a huge red flag for me right away    We ve been texting for   days and did two video calls  She s also conveniently located in Singapore now  Is this a possible scam ,Negative
Reddit,No dates more than a week in advance,I    M  started applying a rule to make my old more efficient and wanted a second opinion  If I have good text banter with someone  and we had been texting for several days to a week  I ll ask her out  and if the answer is anything but a  yes  this week  I m out   With one exception below    My experience is that no one is so busy that they have something to do in the next   consecutive days  And the girls who really wanna meet you will make it easy  the rest of the juice is not worth the squeeze  Literally every date I set up more than a week in advance  no matter the excuse  sickness included  ended in last minute cancellation or generally low interest that wasn t enough to have good dates  On some rare occasions I managed to get the more reluctant girls out  and every time it proved to be a waste of time - either they don t look as good as the profile or they are actually pretty but still acting uninterested on the date  The one exception is if they provide a good excuse and they sound like they actually really regret not having time this week  I just turned one down who we had really good banter with  but I asked her out Tuesday morning and she said  it s too short notice  what s next week like   I told her I don t schedule this long ahead anymore  she got butthurt  I stopped replying and she unmatched me  Sorry bro but you can t completely fail to convey any interest at such a critical point in the interaction as when I ask you out  Even if the banter was amazing  this is the very first time when she can prove that she actually wants to meet  so I judge these few texts very harshly  I also don t wanna spend another week texting someone who has potentially low interest  On multiple occasions I told the girl I m only on board if it s this week and it turned out they were actually free tomorrow and the day after    lol  Am I too harsh ,Negative
Reddit,Make up and filters false advertising  ,Most women you see out an about have some form of makeup on    However most do their makeup really nice for app photos and social media    Now if you look at these side by sides  one  https   ibb co MSdC  N   two  https   ibb co  cfwXkT   Now both of these women look mostly different and thats just make up granted it s not the lazy method of using filters    I m not even gonna dive into plastic surgery or clothing designed to make her ass look bigger  boobs looks bigger  and waist and tummy appear slim     Now is this fair to men  That you portray yourself on apps one way but outside the apps at home you look like completely different people      Now before anyone comes in here saying men can do the same thing    Men are just now getting stuff to artificially enhance perception    Shoes that give you  -  inches in height and you can t tell it s the shoes    Men have limited shape wear   bald men get shit for having a toupee or trying to make the hair work     Anyways what s your thoughts on this and is it false advertising,Negative

Reddit,Long-Distance Internet Romance first meeting  Seeking Advice,Three years ago  I matched with a guy from the UK on eHarmony while on a free trial   I live in the US   We initially connected over our shared interests and felt a strong connection but I kinda distanced myself because  well  the distance  So we kept in touch intermittently while pursuing other relationships  Recently  we reconnected and realized our feelings for each other are stronger than ever  We ve been in constant communication  primarily through FaceTime and are quickly becoming best friends  We both admitted we are falling for each other    He s now planning to visit me for two weeks next month   Edit  staying with me at my place   This is where I need advice  I have never been in a long-distance relationship before  or one that started online  and the thought of transitioning our virtual connection into the real world is both exciting and daunting  I m authentic so I m not worried about that  more so worried about what if we don t feel the connection once he is here  What if I shut down  There is so much pressure with meeting someone for the first time in person and then them staying with you for two weeks   I m reaching out for advice or personal experiences from those who have been in similar situations  How do you navigate the transition from an online to an in-person relationship  especially with the added complexity of long-distance  Any insights or tips would be greatly appreciated   Edit  end goal  we have discussed what happens if things go well  I would move there after a year of us both going back and forth  ,Positive

Reddit,Facebook Dating  for friends ,During the last few years I ve used Facebook Dating  it s been among the worst OLD apps I ve used and not deleted   Now Facebook has implemented this Friends aspect of the app and I ve been connecting with women  seeing more interesting women than I ve seen on the dating side of the app  I am genuinely looking at them in the friends context  The first one I ve actually struck up a conversation with pretty quickly just asked me what I am doing one evening this week  Seems like she wants to date  Has anyone experienced this   When I see the  Friends  profiles  they look indistinguishable from dating profiles in their presentation  This seems reasonable because I have not been asked by the app to create a different profile  I guess I am just wondering if people are using this side of the app to connect with people romantically despite it being a Friend connection  What has your experience been ,Neutral

Reddit,Dating multiple people at once,Hello  I    F  am very new to the online dating world  recently out of a LTR  and need some advice   I ve been talking to a few people and I ve never been in the position where l ve had good conversations with more than one person or dating more than one  Until now  I typically go for quirky  nerdy guys and will date one person at a time  but I am talking to   guys currently  Tony  Jay  and Carter   I m not looking to jump right into a serious relationship but I am open to it if the right person comes along  I ve never had a casual relationship either which I m also open to   I had a first date with Tony earlier on in the week and there was a lot of making out and physical chemistry  We didn t sleep together but I have a feeling it could happen on the second or third date  I m not sure if he s someone I d date seriously  or if l m someone he d date seriously  and I get the vibe that he s the possessive clingy type  Conversation kinda died off as soon as things got more physical  We have a second date planned for the end of this week   I had a phone conversation with the second guy  Jay  which was great and we have a date scheduled for next week to finally meet in person  He seems really interesting and we have a lot in common and I m hoping we get along in person   I had another first date with Carter who was very sweet and we shared a kiss at the end of the night  He seems really kind and considerate and I think my attraction will build for him  He s been in consistent contact which has been nice without it being overwhelming    I m just not sure how to go about dating multiple people  Do I tell them I m seeing others and not in a rush for a relationship  or ask them what they re looking for  whether it s casual or not   Do I assume that they re sleeping with other women  I don t want to hurt anyone so should I hold off on sleeping with anyone until I think it s something that can be exclusive  Am I supposed to cut contact with everyone else if I decide to sleep with someone ,Neutral

Reddit,I am not sure if I should continue having conversations with this guy ,I find myself in an uncertain circumstance with this person  a situation that has persisted since our initial conversations  Understanding his intentions is not always clear  and he appears reluctant to reveal much about himself despite the information he has shared with me  I recognize that this uncertainty may stem from various barriers inherent in online communication  such as the lack of intonation and emotions  differences in our communication styles  or potential cultural and language discrepancies    For example  I mentioned that I worked hard to learn Chinese in my childhood  and he responded by saying   You were a good student or you found Chinese challenging  not sure what you mean   Everything seemed fine until he added  not sure what you mean   Although unhappy I responded   I was diligent at the moment because learning Chinese is always time-consuming and challenging to some people  In my opinion  it s harder than English if you want to master Chinese   He said  That s fair  Interesting  I m not familiar so I can t rate it  It s dissimilarity to English makes it naturally challenging for someone with only knowledge of a language that originates from Latin   I was not referring to him learning Chinese  it s about my experience as you all know    It s hard to make him resonate with me  There are instances where I initiate a conversation with a general statement without providing a thorough explanation  and his response gives the impression that I didn t explain myself clearly  which is quite upsetting  English is not my mother tongue  so every time he expresses uncertainty about what I mean  I wonder if my English is not good enough or our communication has some issues    He often comments on my personality  saying things like  you seem too upbeat  when I said I need to prepare for an exam or  you appear conservative   attempting to analyze me  Moreover  he expresses a liking for this particular aspect of my personality  Frankly  I m not keen on having my mind read and being liked solely based on someone else s preferences  I prefer more engaging and interactive conversations   Given my limited dating experience  this guy appears somewhat reliable  as he  at his age  is seeking a life partner  aligning with my goals  Yet  I am uncertain whether to continue our conversations or move on to the next person  Our interactions generally lack humor or excitement  and at times  I find myself frustrated or confused  I haven t met this person yet but not much will change if he behaves always this way  Please advise   Thanks ,Negative

Reddit,Current match experience - ask for a video call asap,I matched on Hinge with a guy  He had a cute dog and first red flag was that he said he will get rid of him because of time management  We switched to WhatsApp    After a day of sharing about each other he writes this   I have to tell you that you re the first person I ve met on the site who really wants to be serious  and I d like you to be the last if you feel the same way I do  The important thing for me is that we get to know each other first  and if we can build our paradise just for the two of us and our children  that would be great  I noticed in your writings sincerity and simplicity which struck me  I hope to bring you the joy of love  Are you really up for a true story     I respond saying we should video chat the next day  Long story short  on video chat I get played a loop video of him half naked  holding the dog  with a big smile on  I ask him why I can t see him through the camera  we drop the call  try again  same story  apparently bad connection  In writing I tell him I couldn t see anything and that I want a video of him  He sends me the exact same video again  I pretend I don t get what is going on  cause I hoped to get him to talk on the phone at least but I didn t send him a video in return so he got cold feet    Ladies and guys who are on online dating platforms  please demand a video call as soon as possible  a real person or someone who doesn t have anything to hide will video chat with you anytime  Please be safe and don t send money to anyone who you did not meet irl  at least  ,Negative
Reddit,Are They Putting Off Meeting or Am I Being Rejected ,I matched with someone on a dating app a few months ago  We both kinda drifted apart bc initially he said he didn t think we were compatible and he popped back up again a month later to say sorry  He said if he s ever in my side of town  can he get in touch  He has a brother who lives here  I told him yes  We live about    mins away but in the same state  Then he mentioned that he could probably see me Thurs or Friday and asked how my schedule looked those days  I said I m free so those days work  I assumed he was mentioning coming up that week but I heard nothing from him  It wouldn t have happened anyway bc we got snow  but what bothered me is him not saying anything  I ve offered to come to his side of town in the past but it seems he rather come to me  So I sent him a text on Monday  being light hearted asking what happened to him  He responds the following evening     hrs later  with  I promise I will let you know when I m up there   I left it on  read      So is it safe to assume that response is rejection or should I show some grace and consider that maybe they have a lot going on in their life atm  Never had this issue before ever  Most times I meet someone and always leads to another date or meet up  Just seems weird to me that in the beginning they were big on meeting right away and now it seems like an almost impossible   I guess I just need clarity or closure because I m planning to communicate my disappointment in their ways and block them so they can stop reaching back out ,Negative
Reddit,Facebook Dating,Not getting any more matches  Is it a Bug  Last year i got like  -  matches a day and now zero wtf is this ,Negative
Reddit,People with disability arent on dating apps ,I realised something the other day and it bothered me   with hundreds thousands of profile i ve seen  I dont think i ve seen anyone with a disability yet  I know this isnt something you put first on your profile for everyone  but i ve add a fair share of discussions and dates  and im yet to encounter someone who is blind deaf in a wheelchair  Althought i know most disabilities are invisible   So i thought maybe it s a hassle for them  thinking about visually impaired people mostly  to use apps  or navigate the city to go to dates  Or they arent around because they feel judged and ostracized   I wouldnt mind a single bit if someone couldnt see my ugly ass  well assuming my voice isnt as repelling as my face   On a serious note it bummed me out a lot     x   B     x   B ,Negative
Reddit,What the hell is up with Happn ,Recently I tried using Happn on web browser and after going through only a handful of profiles  it has stopped showing me anyone  I ve opened it in my nearest metropolitan city and still nothing  Do I have to pay for this shit  Is this app some massive grift  I need to know if I m doing something wrong here or if I should just start trying to meet women in the real world ,Negative
Reddit,Is there a site app besides HIKI ,I m a   M with autism  and unfortunately the only app or site for people with autism  or who are neurodivergent  that I know of  is HIKI   which just doesnt work unless you re american  Are there any sites or app that cater to or are autism nsurodivergent friendly ,Neutral
Reddit,Getting back into dating  but I attract the wrong intent ,EDIT  I didn t make this post to generalize  Dating is tough for every gender  and I don t think that men are the problem  no one particular group is  I just was asking to clarify on my own actions and get advice on how to do better    So I m a    year old female and recently decided to start using the apps  It sucks  but nothing insane I guess   My biggest problem is that I keep getting people intent on a one-night stand rather than a date  My profile lists my intentions as  serious long term relationship  and I only swipe on men that match that  My pictures are not sexual  My prompts and about me are more personality and interest responses  But I still keep getting dudes who kind of avoid the romantic interest and move into sexual  I get it  we re all thirsty out here  I love sex as much as the next person  But I want to be wooed and courted a little  What am I doing wrong  Men  is this just normal  I don t know   I also am not overly flirtatious or trying to have sex immediately  I get enough sex and have been so tired of the hookups  hence  the apps  I m reasonably attractive but nothing mindblowing  I just wanna date lol  I just want to find love and keep it ,Postive
Reddit,Date invites ignored,So we matched on tinder and during the initially got her to be interested to get a sorbet during a conversation about sweets  However  neither of us were free that week and the coming one as well  In the meantime  conversation is good and things look good  Now when I try to bring that up again she just continues the conversation while ignoring my date invites  I know I must act as if it did not happen but how do I proceed from here ,Negative
Reddit,Dating Apps Don t Work for me,Hey fellow Redditors   I ve been wrestling with my experience on dating apps and could use some input  It s challenging to articulate  but I ve noticed that the people I ve genuinely felt a connection with weren t necessarily conventionally attractive or out of this world interesting  There was however this elusive spark  an instant connection that made the process of getting to know them feel effortless  These people I have always met in person    It seems like dating apps simply do not work for me  It s impossible for me to find that unique spark in initial conversations since its online  How does one reckon with translating that intangible chemistry into online dating   Has anyone else felt this way  I d love to hear your thoughts and experiences  Let s delve into the complexities of dating and share insights ,Neutral
Reddit,Is it normal to pretend like you don t know things that were explicitly on my profile ,I just started online dating not too long ago so I ve been on two dates with two different girls and in conversation both of them asked a question that I figured was already know based on the answer being on my profile    For example   Girl A asked if I liked dogs and if I had one  Well my first picture is literally me with my dog    Girl B asked what my age was  Again obviously that s on my profile   Is this normal for being to pretend like they don t know or were they really that oblivious ,Neutral
Reddit,Zoomer women making their entire personality being mentally ill,So many of women s dating profiles have  crazy   delusional   batshit crazy  on them and nothing else  They want to soley market themselves as mentally ill for some reason  and have that be their only discernible personality trait  It comes across as fake - people with actual mental health issues don t flaunt it and romanticize it  In terms of how dating profiles social media work - you market yourself as how you want to be PERCEIVED rather than actuality - so it really irks me that people want to be perceived as mentally ill   Zoomers in particular think it s   cool  and  edgy   They see being mentally stable and healthy as not cool    And these women aren t even delusional a lot of the time  like none of these women have schizophrenia or psychosis  lol they re   delusional   in the sense that they freak out when hot men don t pay attention to them and string them along  It s not like they re out here actin like Terry Davis,Negative
Reddit,Stir app just a big scam ,Noticed most profiles I m seeing have peculiar prompt answers  that other profiles use verbatim  spelling mistakes and emojis exactly the same  ie  same prompts  different name  stats  pics   The thing is  it seems really pervasive on this app  I ve also matched and chatted with some of these profiles  and they can talk convincingly like a local real person for about an hour before going silent forever  Some I even schedule dates with that flake  but only later find another profile with thier  exact  same prompts and answers   I haven t seen any discussion on this so  am I just new and this is a known part of OLD  Are these AI bots or super catfishes using multiple profiles or what  Does Match pay people in metro locations to pretend to be women  in hopes of upping paid conversions ,Negative
Reddit,BASED ON LOOKS,What is something someone can say on a profile  and then highlight the lie to make it more self presentable on a profile  Like a woman who might be overweight  will put  curvy   Since its online dating  we dont have to be completely honest  since they aren t seeing as in person right away  so their perceptions are just based off what we show  So what are some other exmaples  What would a guy put  ,Positive
Reddit,Bumble -  Your Move ,I m new to online dating and am on   different apps  eharmony  FB and Bumble    I started a conversation with a guy last night and after a while I felt like I was carrying the entire conversation   Several quick answers to my questions but no question back   I m assuming he s at least someone interested as we matched   However  he had a one word response to one of my questions and by the end of the night I just got bored and signed off for the night   Now the app says it s  My Move     I read that you have    hours to respond initially  but does this match expire after    hours once the conversation starts   Is he able to respond even though it s my move or does the app only allow a back and forth dialogue   Ugh   Now I know why people complain about using dating apps ,Negative
Reddit,I deleted Tantan after my first two matches were scammers,Is this reasonable  The first one was some kind of escort  probably a fake one  and the second one I thought we were having a pretty genuine conversation but then after a few hours she wanted me to buy crypto  After barely over    hours I gave up on the app ,Negative
Reddit,How long would you say is average in between messages ,Ive been OLD for maybe a week and ive had a couple matches but one thing im noticing is if someone texts me back I ll normally reply within the hour max like   hours if im working but then they ll take a day to reply or I ll message them in the morning and they ll reply about    hours later  Sometimes I ll talk to someone in real time late at night but that s not often  Is this just standard for OLD or am i just not making interesting enough conversations,Neutral
Reddit,RULES Update   Read before posting or commenting ,As the amount of spam  nonsense posts  unnecessarily rude comments  etc  has increased and we ve been banning   -    users a day  we felt it was a good time to review some of the rules and guidelines for posting and commenting here  PLEASE note  like in most other large subs  violating these rules typically results in a  permanent ban    they are clearly posted here  please do not send us a modmail after the fact saying you did not know the rules  we spend countless hours moderating the sub  we don t need to work even harder because you couldn t take a few minutes before posting to read the rules    First off  since this is a common modmail issue we get    NOTICE FOR NEW USERS    We use automod to filter out new accounts and those with low karma due to the number of new accounts being used to create rule-breaking posts  If you are a new user or have low karma and your post or comment does not appear you likely do not have enough karma or enough days on reddit  Please wait until you have been on reddit and built up karma    With that said when posting here  there are a few things you should think about    A    First  is this post relevant to online dating  this is a place of encouragement and support for online dating users  not a place to bash online dating  ask about things irrelevant to online dating  or go off on a rant  etc    B    Second  will this post help the community  This is a community-minded forum  not your personal soap box or diary  Posts should be questions that are beneficial to the community and help others learn   posts that are simply rants  have no purpose  serve no point  appear more like a diary entry or don t ask a relevant question shouldn t be posted here  Posts should form a question that users can answer    C    Third  please do not ask nonsense  silly or unanswerable questions  Questions should be things random strangers can give an informed opinion on   asking why a match hasn t replied  why you can t get matches  why someone blocked you  etc  should be avoided as no one here can answer why a random stranger isn t interested in you    D    Fourth  this is not a dating sub  a make friends sub or a profile review sub  This is not the place to seek dates or friends or to have your dating profile reviewed    When commenting here  there are a few things you should think about    E    First  please be respectful with your comments  Other users may have different opinions  but please be considerate  This is especially true for top-level comments   please do not antagonize people who have posted a top-level comment just because you disagree with it    F    Second  we try to be fair and equal to everyone  however we seem to have a number of users who call users names  call another user sexist or misogynist  etc  This is not acceptable    G   Third  comments should give an opinion relevant to the post or answer the question in the post  Comments which don t directly answer the question should be avoided    In addition to the above  some of more important rules to remember are as follows          The purpose of this sub is to discuss online dating   issues with apps  questions about app or dating experiences  questions about profile setup  questions about dating experiences  etc  It is NOT a sub to find dates or to post your dating profile  This sub would be cluttered as could be if everyone were to post looking for dates  additionally  it s unlikely many people on here would be anywhere near you geographically anyway         Similarly  do NOT post referral links  surveys  affiliate links  ask for referrals  promote yourself  spam  etc  This is not the place to ask for or post your links to join a dating site  referrals to a dating app  etc  This is not the place to promote yourself  your business  your app  your subreddit  your website  etc  Absolutely no surveys  school surveys  etc          Please be considerate of others and their opinions  It s understandable that different users may have different views and that is fine  but there have been a few  troll  accounts that have gone around doing nothing but posting rude comments for no real reason  This will not be tolerated  Be considerate of others  avoid foul language  do not antagonize or call others names and avoid being rude to others  Additionally  while it is wonderful if you make friends here  please be mindful of other users privacy   many post on here for opinions and comments  not to make friends or find a date  Please do not ask posters to  DM  you or provide you with their contact information  etc  Many users are not interested in corresponding outside of the sub and that should be respected        Posts here are open to all users to answer  Please do not attempt to limit what users may answer  Posts that state  women only    men only    older daters only  etc  are not acceptable          No guides  articles  tips and tricks or how-tos  This is not the place to post guides  opinion pieces  advice  tips and tricks  articles  essays  advice columns  etc  Additionally  posts should not be needlessly long or appear more like an essay than a question        No nonsense  silly or unanswerable questions  Posts here should ask a question that a random stranger would be able to answer   Questions that a stranger can not be reasonably expected to answer such as  Why did my match block me    Why didn t my date want to meet again    Why don t I get matches   Should I use dating apps    What is the best app to use    Is OLD a good idea   etc  should not be asked         Similar to     posts should be a question which have some purpose or point  While complaining is one thing  if your post is better suited for r rant  it will probably be removed  Posts which are nothing but venting or ranting or appear more like a diary entry may be removed        Similar to     if you don t have good experiences with or don t like online dating  fine  However  as this is r onlinedating  we like to have a welcoming and open atmosphere towards online dating  not to scare people away from it  Posts saying that online dating sucks  is terrible  shouldn t be used  that people should  get outside and get off online dating   etc  should not be made  Likewise  repeatedly making these types of comments also is not acceptable  An occasional comment here or there that is critical about online dating is fine  but this is a sub to support and help people who use online dating  not to discourage them       No antagonizing users who post top level comments  If someone posts a top-level comment and you have a differing opinion  please respect their comment  You can post your own top-level comment  however  picking a fight  and antagonizing someone else for their own opinion in a top-level comment should be avoided        No  one and done profile reviews  or help make my profile posts  In general the idea of the sub is to be a place that others can learn from and a place that benefits others and not just the OP  In that spirit and because of the number of people that have been posting  profile review  posts or asking for help creating a profile  in general these are not allowed  These posts clutter the sub  are beneficial only to the OP and in many cases it is the only post the OP makes here  If a user is a regular user of the sub and is seen often helping other posters  we will consider making an exception to this rule for them        This is not an AMA or sex sub  This should go without saying  but this is not an AMA sub for you to brag about how you got     dates in a month  etc  There are other subs dedicated to AMA s  Likewise  with the nature of online dating it is understandable that some sexual things may be mentioned in a post  however this should be limited to brief basic relevant details   there should be no in-dept sexual discussion nor should the post read more like a fantasy novel then a post relevant to the sub  Posts should be closer to PG then to R        Moderator Discretion  This is not one we wanted to add  but due to the number of banned users who modmail us and argue that what they did doesn t perfectly fit one of the rules we are going to add that the mods here have discretion as to if a post or comment is allowed or not and to ban or warn users   Sorry for the length  but with the amount of posts and comments we ve had to remove  we want to be clear what is acceptable here  If you have a question  please ask  With all that being said  WELCOME  Thanks for stopping by  And if you feel something violates the rules  remember to hit the REPORT button ,Negative
Reddit,Update ,I m pretty sure he blocked me lmfao   Like I said earlier I asked him for coffee this weekend just to see if he d actually go  This was at     ish am  It is now almost  pm and no response  So I texted him saying that I was going to take him not responding as an answer  I appreciated the conversation and I wished him the best    Message has not been delivered  Not even man enough to say no    It s honestly not a big deal because I kinda already knew it was going to end this way  Thanks everyone for giving helpful advice ,Negative
Reddit,Should I pay for his ticket if I cancelled ,Hello  I am a girl  and I recently started texting a guy on a dating app  and he seemed okay initially  and we decided to meet  So he offered to come to my city     minute train ride   and booked an advance ticket for      roughly       However  he started getting a bit weird as the meeting date approached  and I started feeling like we won t really get along   Even when we were planning the date  I asked him what cuisines he likes  and he told me he is open to anything  So I started looking up restaurants on Google  and he didn t exactly like any of the options  This went on for a bit  I then said we could go for pizza  so I suggested another restaurant  which he didn t like  Eventually  I suggested another cheap one that I didn t exactly want to go to  and he wanted to go there  I honestly wasn t feeling it by that point  so I cancelled and offered to pay him for his train ticket  However  now I m sitting here and wondering  am I obligated to pay him the full price of the ticket since he didn t get a refundable one   Sorry  I m clearly very inexperienced with dating and would love some honest advice  Thank you      UPDATE  I paid the full amount  lol  Thank you ,Positive
